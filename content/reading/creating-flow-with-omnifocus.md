This one was kind of a surprise read for me. I’ve written before about how much I have OmniFocus is integrated in my life. And when this book popped up in one of my RSS feeds I decided to give it a read. It’s definitely not a cheap book and I jumped over the first half as it’s basically an introduction into OmniFocus which I already know how to use. The book isn’t a total game changer, but the latter half gives some good food for thought on how to make the most of OmniFocus’ Perspectives and some unusual use cases for it.
