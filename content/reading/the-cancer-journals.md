I found this book while browsing through the local book store. And I found it really intriguing because even though cancer seems to be everywhere and all around us in some ways and I've had a number of friends and family suffer through and even die of cancer, it's not something I've personally experienced. Especially not going through a mastectomy as a black, queer woman in the 70s. So I was interested in reading a personal account of something that I will never actually experience myself. And I'm very glad I did. Lorde talks very directly and openly about the struggle she went through, the adversaries she faced, as well as the things that helped her through. I can very much recommend reading it.
