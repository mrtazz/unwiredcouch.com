I wasn't sure what to expect from this book and I will say that it definitely
threw me off a couple of times. The writing style changes a lot throughout the
chapters and the topics do as well which is something I personally often have a
hard time following along with. Which also meant it took me quite some time to
finish it. But I overall enjoyed it and there is quite a lot of text about
finding (defining?) one's purpose and identity amongst other things.
