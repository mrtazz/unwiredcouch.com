I had originally started reading this on my Kindle in 2016 but quickly abandoned it. I then thought it was because I didn't find the book too interesting but I found out some time later that I just didn't enjoy reading on the Kindle much. So having moved to reading exclusively on paper over the last couple of years, I gave the book another try this year and absolutely enjoyed it. There's a lot of fascinating facts and insights into research in there. And a lot of examples to try out yourself to realize that your own brain works the same way. I took a lot of notes for this one and can definitely recommend it.
