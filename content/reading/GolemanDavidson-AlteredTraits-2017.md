I went into this book with a lot of expectations. I was very curious about the
science behind meditation and how to approach the topic in a scientific way.
While ultimately that information was in the book to some extent, it overall
wasn't what I had hoped it would be. First of all there is _a lot_ of
namedropping happening. So for a quite some time I was busy with going back to
re-read who someone was, or wondering whether I should care to remember that
person's name because it would be important later on. This is likely very
interesting to someone who is already familiar with well-known people in the
field of meditation but was mostly distracting for me. The tl;dr for the book
seems to be that there are still more questions than answers about the science
behind meditation and how to explain the clearly visible benefits with a lot
of long time practitioners. But to me that could have been a blog post and not
such a long book.
