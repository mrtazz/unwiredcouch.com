When I ordered [the first Metal Gear Solid book][1] I also ordered the second
one at the same time. And I will say that it reads much the same way. I
personally find the story of the Metal Gear Solid 2 video game less exciting
than the first one as well. I also never played it as a kid so it's missing a
ton of nostalgia for me as well. But the second book basically is written in
the same style than the first one. It was an easy read but not something I
wouldn't necessarily recommend unless you are a huge MGS fan and want to
consume literally everything that exists in that universe.
