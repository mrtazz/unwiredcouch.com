I absolutely enjoyed this book and devoured it in 2 days or so. Janna Levin
has a fantastically fun and entertaining way to talk about the most
fascinating things. And black holes sure are fascinating. There were a lot of
parts in the book where I was sure I'm not getting quite the importance of the
implications she explained. Or even the science on the highest of levels. But
I enjoy thinking about space. And the book did exactly that.
