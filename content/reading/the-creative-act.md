As a long time fan of a lot of the music that Rick Rubin has produced I was
really curious about his take on creativity and the pursuit of making art. And
there were a lot of interesting bits in there. I found his views on the
pressure to make something that will be popular and how to approach
experimentation really interesting. And also the contrast of emphasizing the
more structured parts like note taking and practicing was very interesting.
Overall I think the book could've been a lot shorter as some parts felt
repetitive in some ways. And of course it mostly leaves out the challenges of
making a living with art. But I still overall enjoyed the book.
