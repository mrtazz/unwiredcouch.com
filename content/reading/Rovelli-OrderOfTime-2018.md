I went into this book expecting much more physics than what was actually in
there. There was definitely a lot of explanation of concepts on a high level.
But overall the book felt much more on the philosophy side of things. Which -
after realizing and getting used to it - I really liked. The thing I struggled
with was the fact that so much is explained via entropy in the book. And
entropy has always been a hard topic for me to wrap my brain around. Even in
university. So there were some parts that left me more confused than I would
have liked. Due to no fault of the author.
