The feeling of acceleration and "missing time" has been on my mind for quite a
while (in which I'm probably not alone) and when I heard about this book I was
immediately intrigued. And since the author is German I decided to read it in
German as well. I don't have a lot of experience in reading German sociology
texts, let alone ones written in an academic setting. And I will say that I
definitely struggled and it took me a lot longer to read the book than usual.
But there are a lot of interesting ideas in there. The interconnection of
acceleration in technology, societal structures, and personal lives and how
they reinforce each other is something I definitely want to work through and
think deeper on.
