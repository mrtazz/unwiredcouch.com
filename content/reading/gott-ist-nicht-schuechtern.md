I had read books by Olga Grjasnowa before and really liked her style and view
on the topics like migration and multi-lingualism. So I started reading this
book on winter break and I wasn't really prepared for the how real and rough
this story is. It details a lot of the cruelties that happen to the
protagonists during mid-2010s Syria and their route to flee the country. It
took me some struggling to get through it but also gave me a lot of additional
perspective on the realities of living in a country that often struggles with
the question of whether and how many refugees to take in. It's not an easy
read but I can recommend it.
