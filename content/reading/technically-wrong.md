This is a fantastic book. It walks through many different facets of how interfaces are causing people to have a hard time instead of being useful. And looks at many different factors contributing to the status quo. Iâ€™ve definitely spent a lot of time educating myself on the topic before and while some things I already knew about, the book provided a great mix of new information, different view points, and reminders for myself. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone working in tech.
