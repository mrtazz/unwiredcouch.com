In my journey this year to read a bit more about economic topics, I came
across this book in my bookstore and was curious about. There's lots of
discussion currently about how bad capitalism is but I haven't seen a ton
about what could be better. So I was curious to read more about that part. The
book overall did an ok job there. A lot of cases are outlined where people went
against "common sense" of capitalism and increasing shareholder value and
built or grew companies that were and are very successful. There are a lot of
examples there that the author outlines as strong reasons to be hopeful.
However reading this in 2025 where things feel like they've only gotten worse
in the years since the book got published a lot of it rings kinda hollow. And
the examples feel more like anecdotes than signs for a better way. It's a very
well written and researched book. And I think if I had read it in 2021 I
would've taken away a lot more positive things.
