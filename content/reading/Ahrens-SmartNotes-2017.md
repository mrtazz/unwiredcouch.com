I really like this book even though it’s fairly academic to a large extent.
I’ve heard about the [Zettelkasten method][1] quite a bit especially recently
and I was very curious to learn more about it. Coming to the book with that
context, I didn’t mind the academic style of the book too much. However it’s
definitely more a book that makes you reflect on how you want to take notes
and why more than giving you a concrete guide on what to do.

After finishing the book I took some time to think about how a Zettelkasten
style note taking setup would best fit into my day to day. And how I would
want to interact with such a setup. And I’m still in the process of moving my
old notes into the system and figuring out how it works out for me. So while I
can’t say anything yet about how effective the things are that I learned
through the book, I found it intriguing enough to make me adapt the method and
try it out.
