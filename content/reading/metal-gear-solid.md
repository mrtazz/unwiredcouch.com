As someone who has played the original Metal Gear Solid game multiple times on
the first Playstation as well as the Switch and has fond childhood memories of
the story I was curious how it could or would translate to a book. And I can
say I definitely wasn't impressed. The book is written fairly cringy, and
especially the way the boss fights had to be adapted to a book was awkward at
times. And often times it feels like pages needed to be filled by mentioning
the full name, number, and make of the weapons Snake is using - almost missing
the serial number as well. I don't regret reading it but I wouldn't call it
good literature either.
