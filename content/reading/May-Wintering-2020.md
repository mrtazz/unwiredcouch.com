I stumbled upon this book in the book store and was immediately intrigued by
this idea of "winter" as a global but also personal season of struggle, death,
and renewal. The author shares a lot of personal stories of struggle and
accommodating the inevitable in her life. And the idea that a lot of people
try to pretend winter isn't happening or at least wishing for months that it
was summer. Which is something that rings very true for me as someone who
routinely falls into a winter depression around January when it's been cold
and grey for more than 2 months here in Berlin.
