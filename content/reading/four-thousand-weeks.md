I read this book after I had one friend really enjoy it and another one finding the audio book pretty insufferable. Which is an interesting combination to say the least. Overall I did enjoy the book a lot. Even though I could definitely see the preachy and more annoying parts of it. The general message of the books is that we don’t actually have that many weeks, so it’s worth it to think about how to spend them. What kind of things actually are enjoyable (of the things that we do voluntarily) and which things we can more or less do away with.
