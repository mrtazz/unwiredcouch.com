This was another super interesting read. Itâ€™s long but also gives an interesting overview over human history from different angles than usual. A lot of trade-offs of evolutionary steps are discussed. And ideas like a common belief (religion, capitalism) being a necessary establishment to allow for communication (and collaboration to some extent) across larger territories than just family or tribe boundaries. It also talks a lot about the cruel aspects of human dominance on the planet.
