Usually I tend to shy away from longer (i.e. over 300 pages) books because I
feel like I’m a somewhat slow reader. And it takes me too long to get through
and I feel demotivated to pick the book up. Sapiens still really piqued my
interest and it absolutely delivered.

The overall book is structured in chapters about the cognitive revolution, the
agricultural revolution, the unification of humankind, and the scientific
revolution. I’ve never thought about historical periods in that way and it was
interesting to see them presented in that way. The book covers the usual things
like evolution of Homo Sapiens with a bigger brain than other species, the
early periods as hunter gatherers, the emergence of agricultural and the
connected settling down.

The book also discusses cultural things like a common belief (e.g. religion or
capitalism) being a necessary establishment to allow for communication (and
collaboration to some extent) across larger territories than just family or
tribe boundaries. For any evolutionary step the trade-offs in those changes are
also discussed. Especially the cruel(-er) aspects of human dominance on the
planet.

I learned a lot reading this book and it definitely made me think about history
and human evolution from other perspectives than usual.
