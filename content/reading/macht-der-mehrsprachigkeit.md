The book ended up being a super fascinating read about how language and
multilingualism is viewed in Germany. I've found myself reminded of a lot of
things that I've noticed since living abroad in the US and coming back to
Germany. And it gave me a new sense of reality of what it means to arrive and
live in Germany as someone who's first language isn't German and isn't
considered one of the "good" languages either.
