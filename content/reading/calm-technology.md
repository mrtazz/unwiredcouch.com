I was pretty excited about this book. I used to follow Amber Case on social media and she did some interesting early IoT stuff. But the book overall is written with mostly anecdotal examples and not many directly practical things. It also has some confusing layout quirks that occasionally makes it hard to read. But content wise it's pretty good if youâ€™re new to the topic.
