This has come up in various discussions again and again so I finally decided to read it. I didn’t really enjoy reading it much. It’s a good book and has a lot of good points. But also a couple I disagree with. But having worked so much in DevOps context, the book didn’t offer me anything new. More so some of it actually is opposite to my experience. Which made it even harder to continue reading it.
