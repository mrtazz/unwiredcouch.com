I absolutely loved this book. It was more of a flip through and reading
individual chapters for me than a book I read front to back. The chapters
cover the author’s creative journey, some general advice for artists, art
fundamentals, character design, and even a chapter on managing a family life
while also making time and space for art. Every chapter and its sub sections
contain a ton of very helpful examples. All drawn in Simone Grünewald’s well
known style. So it’s easy to see how to approach faces, noses, hair, old and
young people. And even flora and fauna.

The whole book is absolutely fun to read and I can highly recommend it for
learning and inspiration.
