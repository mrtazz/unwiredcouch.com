This book sparked my interest while I was looking for improving my daily routines. I was often just starting the day as it happened often leaving me feel disorganized, unproductive, and imbalanced. Reading "Manage your Day-to-Day" gave me a lot of ideas of what things to try and add to my daily routine. And also to try and even have a daily routine. Something I picked up again through this book was journaling and while it has been on and off for the last couple of months I really enjoy it. The book was not mind blowing for me but I enjoyed reading it and definitely would recommend it if you are looking for inspiration for your daily routine.
