I found this one by accident while shopping at the local bookstore.  The book
ended up being a super fascinating read about how language and multilingualism
is viewed in Germany. I've found myself reminded of a lot of things that I've
noticed since living abroad in the US and coming back to Germany. And it gave
me a new sense of reality of what it means to arrive and live in Germany as
someone who's first language isn't German and isn't considered one of the
"good" languages either.
