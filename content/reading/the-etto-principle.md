It's no secret that I'm interested in [human factors and system safety][1] and how to apply lessons learned to our field of creating and managing complex computer systems. So it also shouldn't be a surprise that this book really hit home for me. It's well written and touches on a myriad of different aspects about how we trade off thoroughness for efficiency and how
production pressure changes our way of making decisions. It's a pretty fast read and I really enjoyed it. It also has a huge references and related literature section following each chapter which makes it great to start diving deeper into the topic.
