I stumbled upon this book somewhere on the internet and ordered it pretty
immediately as I thought it would be a good way to get more exposure into some
realities of trans life. And given this isn't my lived experience - so I don't
have first hand knowledge of things - and I don't want to have my trans
friends have to explain too many, often very painful, experiences to me, I was
happy to have another way to educate myself on my reading list. The book
itself was very informative albeit very UK centered (which is fine and I knew
beforehand). It touches on a lot of the frequently discussed topics of bodies,
transitioning, the role of society and the state, class struggles, and much
more. It also gave me some good input and perspectives to examine my own view
on things. While I'm not an expert on the topic by any means I can definitely
recommend this book.
