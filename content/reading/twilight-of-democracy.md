Starting this book I was a little set back as the author identifies with what
would have been called the “center-right” towards the late 1990s and early
2000s. So I wasn’t too sure where this book would be going. But I ended up
finding it super interesting. The book details some historical background as
well as current workings of politics in various countries like Poland, Hungary,
and the U.K.. There is also a lot of very personal accounts in there about how
friends of the author have drifted more towards the contemporary right and how
that feels. It was overall a pretty harrowing account of what has happened in
some countries over the past 20 years and how much similarity there is between
them.
