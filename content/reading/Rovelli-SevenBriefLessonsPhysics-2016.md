I really liked the book. It was short and digestible but interesting and fun
to read nonetheless. I think I probably have read about most of the seven
things somewhere else before (which doesn't mean I understood or have a good
grasp on them). So it wasn't mind blowing new things I was reading. But
Rovelli has a very philosophical style how he talks about these things which
makes it really enjoyable.
