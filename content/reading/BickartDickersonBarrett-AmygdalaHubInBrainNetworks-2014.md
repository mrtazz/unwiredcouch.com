This was a fascinating paper to read. Mostly because there were so many things
I absolutely didn't get. And yet from reading
[[ref-Barret-HowEmotionsAreMade2017]] there were a bunch of things that I had
heard before and that made sense to me. Especially thinking about the brain
more as a network structure and less than a set of connected control nodes.
And some of the findings wrt how changes in different networks for different
aspects of social life contribute to symptoms that manifest in various
external behaviors (e.g. being cold/distant to loved ones or being easily
fooled by scammers)
