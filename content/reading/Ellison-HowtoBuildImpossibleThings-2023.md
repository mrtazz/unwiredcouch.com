I found this book at my favourite book store and was really interested in it
without knowing too much about it. I initially thought it was more about
actually building things. But the book turned out to be more like listening to
an old carpenter reminiscing about life. Which I thoroughly enjoyed. I come
from a line of car mechanics and carpenters and it reminded me a lot of
talking to my dad or grandpa. The book is divided into chapters on various
topics around life. And usually a lot of them have examples from houses the
author built. Lots of them including the fanciest apartments of New York. Many
stories reminded me of just general vibes in project management even in
software engineering. But also stories I've heard from carpenters and other
engineers. There's a chapter about "Friendship and Death" that made me very
emotional and I actually stopped reading there for a bit. But I can definitely
overall recommend it if "old carpenter talks about life" is a vibe you'd
enjoy.
