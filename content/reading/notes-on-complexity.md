I found this at the local book store and wasn't really sure what to make of it
but found it interesting enough to buy. I've dabbled in complexity theory
topics over the years but haven't really dug deep into it so far.  I overall
really enjoyed the book. It does a good job introducing the basics of
complexity in my opinion and guiding through a lot of historical developments
in math and related fields in relation to the study of complexity. Which also
makes up the majority of the book. The part when the author actually gets to
consciousness is rather short and is more a starting point than a real outline
of their research in my mind. So while I can't say I have a more interesting
insight into consciousness after reading the back, I still took a lot away from
reading it.
