This was a very fascinating book. In part because I have never really attended
an economics lecture. And the ones I did were geared towards very practical
things that we had to learn by hard. So while reading this book I was at the
same time getting used to thinking about economic things in a theoretical
context and taking in the information conveyed in the text. I enjoyed it a lot
and took a lot of inspiration and food for thought from it.
