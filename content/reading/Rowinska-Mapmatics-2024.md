I was super curious about this book. The combination of maths and maps
immediately captured my attention, having been interested in both for a long
time. And I absolutely loved the book. It expectedly goes into detail of the
mathematics to make projections of 3D territory on a 2D plane works and what
the trade-offs are there. But then goes so much wider into (often no well
known) pioneers of map making and how drawing maps can help people but also
have impact on politics in other areas as we essentially draw arbitrary lines
around territories to categorize them. If you like maps and maths I can highly
recommend the book.
