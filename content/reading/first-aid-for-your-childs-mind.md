I also found this one by accident while looking through the book store. It was interesting to read a psychologistâ€™s view on dealing with anxiety in kids. And it turned out to be much more interesting and useful for its explanations of general behaving towards children. The exercises are a bit too involved for me to want to try them. But I can see them being useful.
