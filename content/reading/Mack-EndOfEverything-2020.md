This was an absolutely wonderful and mind blowing book to read. I had to think
a lot of “Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs” while reading it. I feared at first
that it would be too depressing. But the author has an absolutely enjoyable
writing style and it made the whole topic fun and interesting rather than loom
and doom.
