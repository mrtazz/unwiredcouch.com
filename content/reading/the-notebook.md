I honestly devoured and thoroughly enjoyed this book. I've recently been going
back to leaning on my notebooks a lot more for a lot of my tasks including
planning and todos (both at work and personal). So the book just came at the
right time. I gives a wonderful overview over how paper (and notebooks) were
used throughout the centuries by different people of various professions. It
was really interesting to compare how much of these ways of journaling and
taking notes is still in use today and how the question of organization of
notes kinda still has so many approaches. If you like writing on paper, I can
absolutely recommend this book.
