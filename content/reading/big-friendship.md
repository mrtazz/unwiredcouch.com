I didn't really know what to think of this book. I generally enjoyed reading
it. But I think I was expecting something different. I wasn’t expecting more of
a memoir of a friendship but rather thought there was some more general
discussion of the topic of friendship in there. Some parts of the book I wasn’t
super excited by as it either went into a lot of detail about social outings I
didn’t find super interesting or stopped before I felt it went to the core of
the situation.

Overall I liked the book. The big core message of friendship on a deep level
also takes work is something that really resonates with me. There’s too often
the message in media and entertainment that the perfect relationship (romantic
or otherwise) is effortless, which does us all a disservice as we assume we
don’t have to put the work in. But this book talks very clearly about the work
being part of a friendship and I really liked that.
