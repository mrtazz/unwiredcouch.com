I really enjoyed reading this book. For years at this point I've felt like a bilingual in German and English, and I've come across so many situations where I unconsciously chose one language over the other. And then was surprised by it. I've always wondered how bilingualism or multilingualism is reflected in the brain and how it's different between people and languages. "The Bilingual Brain" gives a ton of insight into the research field of multilingulism as well as highlighting the approaches, challenges, and limitations of research in this field. There were many situation in the book, when a common pattern for bilinguals was explained, where I was happy to realize it's something I do to.
