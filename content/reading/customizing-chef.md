I added this as a bonus round, because while I definitely read it, I had the privilege to do so as a reviewer. Iâ€™m really happy that Jon asked me to review his book and while I had done a lot of Chef before, I learned tons about its internals from this book. If you work with Chef and want to get more out of it or even just understand some of the internals a little better, definitely read this book.
