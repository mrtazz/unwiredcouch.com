I don’t remember how I got to this book as I had never heard of Judith Butler
before given I’ve not really had any philosophy or literature classes on a
higher education level and haven’t read much about academic feminist or gender
theory. So I went into this book pretty unprepared and I was immediately in for
a rude awakening. I’ve always thought of my English being pretty decent for a
second language but there were so many sentences in this book that even on the
third try I wasn’t able to grasp. The fact I haven’t read Freud, Lacan,
Foucault, or any of the other works that “Gender Trouble” discusses and bases a
lot of arguments on definitely also didn’t help. Only while I was already
somewhat deep in did I find out that Butler is somewhat notorious for having a
difficult and dense writing style. Nevertheless I stayed curious enough about
the topic to get through the book and it was definitely interesting. I had
heard of gender being a social performance before but reading it in a more
academic context and having more (albeit difficult to grasp) discussion around
it was pretty insightful for me. I don’t know if I’d recommend it unless you’re
really into the topic and have maybe read some of the referenced material. But
I don’t regret reading and struggling through it.
