I deeply enjoyed this book. I’ve had many discussions about Klein’s ideas and
concepts before. I have for example applied his idea of [premortems][1] a lot
before in architectural and operational reviews of technology changes. And his
ideas about knowledge of expert workers is an important part of how I approach
incident reviews and learning from them. The book is also an interesting
opposite view in a lot of ways to Kahneman’s classic [“Thinking, Fast and
Slow”][2] where a lot of emphasis is put on how the human mind can be tricked
or is wrong. I took tons of notes from this book and there were so many things
that reminded me of operating web services or planning and maintaining other
complex systems. Definitely a strong recommendation to read from me.
