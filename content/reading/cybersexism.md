This short book by Laurie Penny is a very good read about sexism in the age of social networks and the omnipresent Internet. It does a great job at talking about how a lot of familiar concepts of "offline sexism" are reinvented online and no news to women. It's short and insightful enough to recommend reading it
without hesitation.
