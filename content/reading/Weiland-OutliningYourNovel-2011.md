I picked this book up because I’ve always been interested in outlining. But
even more so I’ve fascinated by how many people are fans of outlining. To the
point where there are discussion about things like “is OmniOutliner or OneNote
the better outlining app” and the point that there are even dedicated
outlining apps. I’ve mostly done outlining for my writing with bullet points
in a plain text or markdown file. And I wanted to know if I’m missing
anything. In addition to that I also find the process of writing a book or
novel super fascinating. I don’t know if I would want to write one. But the
process of planning, structuring, and writing something of that size I find
very interesting and fascinating. And I wanted to see if I could learn
something from it for shorter writing like documentation and blog posts.

The book is structured in a way where only the first two chapters are really
about outlining itself. The advantages of writing an outline versus writing
“at the seat of your pants” as well as different approaches to outlines (e.g.
mind maps, longform writing, bullet points) are discussed.

The following chapters then are a whirlwind tour through planning a novel and
how to apply outlining to areas like plot planning, character development, or
creating a backstory. At the end of every chapter there is an interview with a
writer about the value and their approach in outlining.

I really enjoyed reading the book. I learned a lot about structuring my
writing and what kind of things go into planning a novel. It’s very accessibly
written and the chapters all have a good length so it never feels like they
are dragged out or missing content. I could have done without the writer
interviews as they didn’t really add a lot to the book but had a couple of
interesting anecdotes. I don’t know if there would be anything new for a
seasoned author in the book, but I can definitely recommend it as a quick
intro into planning a novel.
