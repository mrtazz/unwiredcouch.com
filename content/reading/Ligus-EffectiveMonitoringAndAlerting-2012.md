I was really looking forward to this book as I've heard good things about it
and thought it would round up what I already knew about the topic. However
right from the start it felt rather awkward. The author is trying to maintain
an abstract high level view on monitoring and alerting and not go into
specific implementations. This makes for an awkward combination with it being
basically a 101/introductory book on the topic. A lot of the formal
descriptions of monitoring and alerting feel forced and don't hold up in the
abstract very well and are too high level to be practical. He also talks about
operations in an almost romantic hero style way which I didn't enjoy. In
addition to that the book also includes some final chapters on outage handling
and organizational and cultural setups. The terms human error, root cause
analysis, and "5 Whys" are thrown around a lot with no acknowledgement of it
being actually harmful to learning according to modern research in the field
of systems safety. Definitely not a book I would recommend.
