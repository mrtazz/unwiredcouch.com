I bought this book never really having watched any of Trevor Noah’s comedy or The Daily Show with him. But the book sounded really intriguing to me and I was curious about his life and background. And the book was absolutely fantastic. It’s one of the few books I’ve read where I literally laughed out lout while also being struck and deeply emotional reading through other parts. I've only been to South Africa for a couple of days and only really been to Cape Town. So I’ve had (and still have) very limited knowledge of the history of the country. And the book taught me a ton about what it was like growing up during and after Apartheid and how kids can perceive very extreme and cruel situations. This is definitely one of the best books I’ve read and I can wholeheartedly recommend picking it up.
