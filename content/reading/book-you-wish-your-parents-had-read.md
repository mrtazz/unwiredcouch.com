I liked a lot how the book always came back to talking to the kids and
empathizing with their emotions instead of trying to abolish them. And there
were always good examples that came with every section to illustrate the
point. However it still felt very "good weather parenting" advice to me, in
the sense that it talks about how to do these things when you have the time to
take for it. But there was hardly anything in there about how to deal with
situations where time is tight or there isn't the space to slow down and
prolong the situation.
