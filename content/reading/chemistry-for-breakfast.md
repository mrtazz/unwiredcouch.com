## Personal Thoughts

I really like these kind of "quick lessons in science" style books where
different chapters talk about a specific topic. And this book is no difference.
The basic setup is a day in the author's life where everyday things like
drinking coffee, brushing teeth, or charging the phone are being used to
illustrate the chemistry behind how it works and debunk some common
misconceptions along the way. The book is very entertaining and an absolute fun
and educating read.
