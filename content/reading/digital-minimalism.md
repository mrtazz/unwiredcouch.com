It took me quite a while after buying this book to find the excitement to actually read it. Which had nothing to do with the book itself but the fact that I was already sold on the concept of “Digital Minimalism“ and thought there wouldn’t be new or interesting things for me in there. But I ended up learning a lot about the research into the topic and how many people are thinking about it. And also made me think even more about my own use of technology.
