It took me quite a while after buying this book to find the excitement to actually read it. Which had nothing to do with the book itself but the fact that I was already sold on the concept of "Digital Minimalism" and thought there wouldnâ€™t be new or interesting things for me in there. 

However once I started reading the book I immediately got sucked in and really enjoyed it. The book is very well researched and there are a lot of references to other works and research that are interesting to follow up on. It also contains a good mix of background information and actionable things to do for minimizing digital factors in once life. That makes it really easy (and somewhat also creates the desire to try) to give the exercises for minimization a spin.

My fear of already being sold on the concept and thus the book feeling like preaching to me as the choir were completely unfounded. If anything I got a confirmation and reaffirmation to my own practices of minimizing digital influences on my life.
