I was intrigued by the title when I saw the book in the bookshop as
counterfactuals are something that is seen as not desired in the process of
learning from incidents. So I was really curious how this can serve as a
probably different perspective and interpretation in other sciences. The book
is not a completely easy read and there are definitely dense parts in
understanding the more complex topics like quantum information and heat/work
like transfers. But I can definitely say the book opened my mind to thinking
about capabilities rather than dynamic law like rules of systems and it's
something I still chew on, especially in relation to learning from incidents
and analyzing complex systems to learn from their failures.
