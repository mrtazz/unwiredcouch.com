It took me quite a while to get through this book. I had actually abandoned it
before and then came back to it. It's very theoretical and academic (even
though it contains some suggestions towards more practical applications of the
theory towards the end). There is a lot of interesting thought in there about
how to put something more concrete to the notion of errors or mistakes. And
even if most of it is now superseded it provides interesting insight into the
research of human error during that time.
