I was interested in Eve Ewing’s writing ever since I read her run on Marvel’s
Ironheart. So I got her other books a couple of months ago as well. I started
with "1919" and it was definitely an interesting albeit completely new
experience for me. I've not really read poetry since school where I wasn't a
big fan because it always felt forced. But while reading "1919" I definitely
regretted not paying more attention in school to be able to pick up on the
stylistic and technique choices in the book. "1919" is a collection of poems
with the background of an official report about the 1919 race riots in Chicago
which I had never heard of until I read the book. It was absolutely
educational to read the various passages from the report that were the basis
for the poem. And then get an emotional and very personal feeling poem about
the passage right after. Given my own lack of knowledge about poetry I
constantly felt like I was missing some fascinating nuances about the writing.
And I've started learning more about poetry and creative writing to rectify
that. And I definitely plan to re-read "1919" once I'm more knowledgeable
about poetry.
