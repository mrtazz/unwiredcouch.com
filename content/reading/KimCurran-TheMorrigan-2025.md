After reading [The Bear and the
Nightingale](/reading/katherinearden-thebearandthenightingale-2017/) and
having already ordered the followups I wanted some more mystical fiction books
to read. So when I stumbled upon this book at my bookstore I was immediately
interested. Especially since my knowledge of Irish mythology is/was
practically non-existent and I wouldn't dare claim the parts that made it into
Marvel comicbooks count. The book itself I ended up being kinda meh on. I
think it's written well while still being more crass and gory than I expected.
There also aren't many happy or fun stories in there which is something I've
kinda expected since despite the rampant awfulness that exists in probably all
mythologies, from the Norse, Roman, and Greek mythologies I remembered some
stories that at least had some funny or silly aspects to it. Whereas The
Morrigan is mostly a compendium of men being awful. I'm happy I read it and
having learned a bit more about Irish mythology. But I wouldn't recommend it
as a happy, entertaining read.
