It was fun to read through this book and see different approaches to solving
the problems presented. I didn't follow through all the proofs and steps all
the time because I would have needed to carefully do it with pen and paper and
that was really the mood I was in when I wanted to read. But it made me miss
school math and solving problems a lot. It also ended up being a bit hard to
follow for me occasionally as I read the book in English and most of my math
education was in German. So there were definitely words and terms I wasn't
familiar with at all. Overall I enjoyed reading it.
