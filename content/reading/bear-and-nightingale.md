I got this recommend by a friend as I had just finished [[ref-Cassandra
Clare-City of Bones-2017-11-20]] and wanted something similar in some regards.
And the fact that it was set on the backdrop on some old Russian folk stories
was kinda interesting. And overall the book really held up. The first 100 pages
were really slow, mostly depressing, and I wasn't able to really keep track of
the characters. But after that I was really drawn into the story, to the point
where some parts I found creepy enough that I stopped reading it before going
to bed and read it in daylight instead ðŸ˜…. I finished the final 150 pages or so
in one setting because I really wanted to know how it ends. And then
immediately ordered the two follow up books in the series.
