I've not really concerned myself in depth with the Israel-Palestine conflict
much before. But with all the recent events I wanted to educate myself a bit
more and got this book to read from some people that live there. And I found
the book to be very interesting. Especially the contrast between the letters
written by the author and then the reply letters by Palestinians that are
added in this edition give a good idea about the contrasting (and sometimes
similar) views on the various topics of this situation.
