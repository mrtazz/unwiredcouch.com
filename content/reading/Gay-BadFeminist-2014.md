I really enjoyed reading this book and the author's argument with the fact
that not everybody is perfect and that not everyone needs to be perfect to
strive for feminist ideas to become reality. I've very much identified with
the guilty feeling of enjoying listening to rap music - which is often deeply
misogynistic - yet still wanting to further a more feminist world. And having
to sit through this cognitive dissonance discussion with myself. The book is
written in a very honest and raw way and I can definitely recommend it.
