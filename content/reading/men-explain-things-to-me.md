This collection of essays titled for the aggressive tendency of men to always have to explain things to women while assuming they have no idea what they are talking about. The first essay brings this to a point by telling a story of a party where a man mansplains to the author the book she herself wrote. Without having actually read it. The book than continues with more essays that talk
about a lot more darker things like discussing domestic violence. The over arching theme is that the credibility of and respect towards women is continuously diminished to maintain the status quo and its power imbalance. Some of the essays towards the end of the book are not easy to read but it's more than worth it.

> Credibility is a basic survival tool.
