I was pretty excited about this book. I used to follow Amber Case on social
media and she did some interesting early IoT stuff. But the book overall is
written with mostly anecdotal examples and not many directly practical things.
It also has some confusing layout quirks that occasionally makes it hard to
read. But content wise it's pretty good if you’re new to the topic.
