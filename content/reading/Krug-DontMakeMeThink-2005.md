I'm one of those engineers who used to happily claim to not have any frontend
skills and just not be good at design. I came to loathe this thinking over the
years and decided that if I can't do something I want to learn at least the
basics. This is one of the reasons why I read "Designing for Performance" as
mentioned above. Thankfully I also work with a ton of talented designers and
one of them is [Jessica Harllee](https://twitter.com/harllee). I talked to her
about suggestions to get started with learning about design. And she said I
should read "Don't make me think". And she wasn't wrong. The book is a
wonderful introduction into usability and design. The beauty of it is that
while reading it, all of the things mentioned are total no-brainers. But you
have to remember it while designing things. The other interesting thing for me
was that while all of the examples in the book are web based (with some brief
stints into mobile) I could totally think of CLI apps I've written in the past
that totally do the wrong thing design-wise. Definitely a recommended read.
