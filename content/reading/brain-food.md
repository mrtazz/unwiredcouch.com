I really enjoyed this book and its thorough focus on the biological and
nutritional aspects of nurturing the brain. Especially the very thorough
breakdown of which foods contain which nutrients and how and when they benefit
the brain. For my taste the fairly uncritical recommendations of alcohol
(specifically red wine) and taking at face value the validity of "blue zones"
and centennials (especially after the data seems to be less robust than
previously assumed) as a proof for nutritional choices was less scientific than
it could be. But in my mind didn't retract from the interesting rest of the
book.
