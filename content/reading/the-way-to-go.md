This was a $3 Kindle purchase before I got on a flight. And with the uptick in popularity of the Go programming language I thought it would be a good thing to learn about it. I donâ€™t generally enjoy reading programming books but rather learn by trying to write some code. But this book did a good job of guiding me through the language and I felt pretty confident in diving in and giving it a try. Definitely more than worth the money.
