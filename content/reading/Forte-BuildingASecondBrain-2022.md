This book was a surprisingly quick and easy read. I wasn't really sure if I
was gonna like another book about taking notes (or find it useful) after
reading [How to take smart notes][1] had comparatively little practical things
for me to take away from and implement. But "Building a Second Brain" was very
different in that regard. The book puts a lot of focus on building a system
that is very flexible and adaptable even to stressful schedules. There are a
couple of guiding principles (the PARA folder structure, refining notes
regularly, making it easy to capture notes) that are elaborated on. But there
is a lot of emphasis on making this work in even tiny moments throughout the
week. A lot of the system and ideas reminded me of bullet journaling in a way
which I've been doing for years at this point and has been working very well
for me
