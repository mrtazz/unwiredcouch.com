I got this book in order to get a more nuanced idea about current approaches
to what's generally being called "AI". And especially to read more about the
basic of neural nets since I didn't have a lot of lecture content about it in
university. The book does a really good job of explaining the history of the
field of artificial intelligence and the different cycles of excitement it has
gone through. The author also explains very well the basics of historical and
modern AI technologies and how e.g. images and text are being ingested and
evaluated. The book makes it very clear that tools like neural nets are
automatic classification tools and not more. The book is highly recommended if
you want an understanding of the field without the hype and fantastic claims
that have become so rampant in the last couple of years.
