I went into this book expecting much more physics than what was actually in there. There was definitely a lot of explanation of concepts on a high level. But overall the book felt much more on the philosophy side of things. Which - after realizing and getting used to it - I really liked. The thing I struggled with was the fact that so much is explained via entropy in the book. And entropy has always been a hard topic for me to wrap my brain around. Even in university. So there were some parts that left me more confused than I would have liked. Due to no fault of the author.
