I decided to read this book after I had read [Die Macht der Mehrsprachigkeit](https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/macht-der-mehrsprachigkeit/) by the same author earlier this year. I haven't read a lot of German literature (let alone fiction) since I was in school for no real reason. So I was curious about some more contemporary authors. And the book really wasn't an easy read. It's a very emotional and not often happy story and deals with a lot of heavy topics around war, migration, loss, and what it means to be and have a home. Nonetheless I flew through its nearly 300 pages in about 2 days. And I was sad when I was done as I wanted to keep reading.
