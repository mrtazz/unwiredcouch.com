I started this book many years ago after I had finished watching the Netflix show and really was kinda bummed it ended. So I wanted to continue spending time in that phantasy universe. Initially however I didn't super enjoy the differences between the book and the show (as I really wanted to have it make the show keep going for me) and I had the book on my nightstand for a long time without actually reading it. But then I decided to pick it back up - with some good distance from the Netflix show - and just read it as its own. And I thoroughly enjoyed it and finished it pretty quickly. I also got the follow up book already, so I'm intending to keep going. If you like young adult stories set within a universe of vampires, demons, werewolves, and other fantastical creatures, I can recommend the book.
