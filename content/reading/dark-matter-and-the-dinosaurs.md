I had heard about this book on several occasions and when we went to the natural history museum here in Berlin I found it in the shop and decided to finally buy it. I didn’t really know what to expect but having recently read a couple of popular science books about physics I was very intrigued. And the book did definitely deliver, albeit in a very different way than I thought. I went into reading it with the expectation that the majority of the book would be about dark matter and its details. This however is really only a small part of the whole book. Throughout the book there are detailed explanations about the (presumed) origins of life, the makeup of the cosmos, mass extinctions, determining the age of rocks, history of scientific discoveries and methods, dinosaurs, impact crater anatomy, why Pluto isn’t a planet anymore, why meteroids as we call them often aren’t really meteroids, and much more. At the end of the book the author then circles back to dark matter and some of the recent theories and discoveries, tying all of the chapters together.

I have to admit that occasionally while reading the book I was fascinated by the things I was learning while at the same time not really knowing what it has to do with dark matter. Nevertheless I extremely enjoyed this book and the things I learned reading it.
