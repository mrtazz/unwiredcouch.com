After reading [about the technology of AI][1] I decided to stay with the topic
for a bit longer and also read more about the impacts of the technology and
its deployment on the world outside of plainly looking at the outputs of
the algorithms. Much of it I already knew but the book very clearly looks at
the aspects of environmental as well as human and societal impact of these
technologies for mass data gathering and processing. It's very well written
and recommended even though it's not fun to read about this very dark aspect
of our current age of technology.
