I stumbled upon this in a bookshop and while I knew about Bikini Kill, I can't
say I had listened to a lot of their music before. So I was really curious
what their lead singer's memoir would be like. And even though it has a lot of
hard to read and sad passages I really liked this book. There is so much raw
realness in there and so many interesting passages about their first gigs, the
struggle to keep the band and the zines and all the stuff around it going,
their history with Kurt Cobain, and a lot of sweet details from their
relationship with Ad-Rock from the Beastie Boys. I really enjoyed the book.
