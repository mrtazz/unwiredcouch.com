I don’t really think I got the gist of this book. It had the usual barrier to
understanding that I’ve kinda come to expect from early 20th century
philosophy texts. There is a lot of talking about film specifically and how it
enables misuse of media. And when it comes to the reproducibility of art it’s
mostly said that the “aura” of it gets lost. I'm likely gonna do a second pass
of it at some point maybe with some relevant secondary literature in hand
because I feel like there is more I can get from this text. Especially since
there were many parts in there that lamented the dissolving distinction
between author and audience. And the fact that "everyone these days can
publish whatever they think they have to say". Which feels very similar to a
lot of discourse today about content creation.
