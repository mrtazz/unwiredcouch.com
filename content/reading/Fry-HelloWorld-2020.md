I had this book on my shelf since 2020 or so and never took the time to read
it. With the renewed (and intensified) hype around AI this year I started to
read it even though I wasn’t sure if there was really more about machine
learning that I wanted to know and would find interesting.

But truth be told I really enjoyed reading this book. It’s roughly divided
into topical areas like justice, medicine, cars, and art and discusses the
status quo (as of 2020) as well as improvements and downsides to the rise of
usage of algorithms in general but also machine learning. The author takes a
very nuanced look at all these and it actually made me feel less frustrated
about using computers in some areas than I had been through the public
discussions of AI this year. Highly recommend the book.
