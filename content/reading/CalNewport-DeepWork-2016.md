I read this book during a fairly busy time of my life (both personally and
professionally) and it provided a very welcome perspective on slowing down,
dialing down distractions, and focusing on what Newport calls "deep work".
Which is basically the engaged, deep, focus on the work that really matters
(to oneself, one's career, and goals). And even though that not every work day
in a busy job can accommodate lots of deep work every day, the book made me
sensitive to the topic and seek out more of these opportunities even in
smaller ways.
