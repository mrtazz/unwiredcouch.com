I really liked the book. It was interesting to read about experiences of other
highly sensitive people and to get a view from a psychologist on it. The book
however has a way too touchy-feely style for me. And especially the final
chapters talking about spirituality were a bit much for me. That being said I
took a couple of things away from reading the book, I was more than once ready
to throw the kindle across the room because my sensitivity got super hijacked
by some things, and I'm definitely better informed and at peace with my
sensitivity than I was before.

I had no idea about the concept of highly sensitive people until I read [this
article][1]. It has a pretty click-baity headline but it really hit home for
me. So I decided to learn more about it and this book was the most prominent
resource to pop up in my search. It's a really good book with a lot of great
psychological insights and explicit case studies. At times the way high
sensitivity was described was a bit too feel-good for my taste. At other times
I would almost throw my kindle across the room as the author managed to really
sneak up on and hijack my sensitivity. The book focuses a lot on what usually
goes wrong during childhood for highly sensitive people and makes it a point
to relive memories and traumas through the lense of high sensitivity. This is
a practice I really enjoyed although it felt a bit much to me at times as I
consider my childhood to have been a happy one. On the other hand I started to
do this practice with every day situations at work to help me understand why I
feel what I feel in different situations. I identify myself as a highly
sensitive person and the book was an extremely good read to
help me understand better what this could mean for me and my days.
