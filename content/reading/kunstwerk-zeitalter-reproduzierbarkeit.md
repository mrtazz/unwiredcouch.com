## Review
I don’t really think I got the gist of this book. It had the usual barrier to
understanding that I’ve kinda come to expect from early 20th century philosophy
texts. There is a lot of talking about film specifically and how it enables
misuse of media. And when it comes to the reproducibility of art it’s mostly
said that the “aura” of it gets lost. I'm likely gonna do a second pass of it
at some point maybe with some relevant secondary literature in hand because I
feel like there is more I can get from this text. Especially since there were
many parts in there that lamented the dissolving distinction between author and
audience. And the fact that "everyone these days can publish whatever they
think they have to say". Which feels very similar to a lot of discourse today
about content creation.
