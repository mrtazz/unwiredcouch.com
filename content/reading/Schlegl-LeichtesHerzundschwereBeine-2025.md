I knew the author from when he was moderating tons of shows on VIVA, the
German version of MTV. And I kinda knew that he had mostly given up working in
media to work as a paramedic instead. So when I saw that he wrote a book about
hiking with his mother I was kinda curious about it. I think the start is a
bit bumpy and it feels more like a boring day by day telling of someone not
enjoying their hike. But even though the trip gets harder and harder
throughout the book, the narration gets a lot more interesting and personal.
And the musings about hiking, tourism, but also mortality spoke to me a lot
and I really enjoyed the book overall.
