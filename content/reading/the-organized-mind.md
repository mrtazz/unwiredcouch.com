This book blew my mind (pun intended). There was so much neuropsychology in there that explained so many things about the brain. So many things I always wondered about made so much more sense now. I don’t know if it made me more organized but I have a whole new perspective on attention, memory, sleep, categorization, and so much more. This is one of those “game changer” books for me. I am approaching many things in daily life and even about my inner, emotional life very differently since reading the book. From how remembering and recalling things works (as far as we know currently), to how sleep impacts your brain, how categorization is done by humans (and why you will always end up with a “junk drawer”), and when to not trust your gut. It’s a book I want to read a second time because I don’t feel like I’ve fully taken it in yet.
