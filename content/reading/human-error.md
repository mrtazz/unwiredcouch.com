It took me quite a while to get through this book. I had actually abandoned it before and then came back to it. It's very theoretical and academic (even though it contains some suggestions towards more practical applications of the theory towards the end). There is a lot of interesting thought in there about how to put something more concrete to the notion of errors or mistakes. And even if most of it is now superseded it provides interesting insight into the research of human error during that time.
