I started the year off with finally finishing Germaine Greer's feminist classic
from 1970 about the role of women in modern society. I had known about the book
for a couple of years and after having read “Bell Hooks' The Will to Change:
Men, Masculinity, and Love” last year I decided to finally read it. I definitely
enjoyed it. Especially as a man it opens your eyes to a lot of things you never
encounter in your daily life. It's very graphic at times and there are some
long-winded parts in the middle but I would definitely recommend it to anyone
who's interested in feminism. I also started reading her newest book "The Whole
Woman" this year which is the sequel she never wanted to write. And so far I
like it and it's alarming how few things have changed since "The Female Eunuch".
