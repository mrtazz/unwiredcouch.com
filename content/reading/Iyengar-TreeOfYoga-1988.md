I didn’t much enjoy the book which might be due to expecting something
different. I didn’t have strong expectation but I wanted to get some more
background on where yoga is coming from and what else is part of it to enhance
my own yoga (and maybe meditation) practice. And I’ve definitely learned a
couple of things from the book. But those could have been summarized on 10
pages. The rest of the time I’ve felt the book to mostly be repetitive,
rambling, almost condescending at times, and even occasionally dangerously
wrong (e.g. there’s a section in which it’s said that inverted poses while
menstruating can lead to cancer).

There are definitely good things in there about balance, not seeing yoga
practice as a competition, listening to your body, taking time, etc. But as a
fairly scientific person it’s hard to read over the parts where the last 100
years of modern medicine are ignored.
