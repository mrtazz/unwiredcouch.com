A while into learning how to draw I realized that watercolor is a lot more fun
and versatile than I thought it was from my experience using it in art class
in school. So I researched around and found this book recommended as a sort of
reference book for watercolor artists. And it’s exactly that. The book gives a
great overview over all the different aspects and techniques of using
watercolor. Reading it gave me a much better understanding of the medium and I
still refer back to it to look some things up occasionally.
