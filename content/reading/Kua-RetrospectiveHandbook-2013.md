This book provides a great overview of how to run good retrospectives and
meetings in general. While all the recommendations and tips on there are very
apt and useful I've found it a bit too practical and general. Most chapters
are applicable to any form of meeting (which is good) but I would have loved a
deeper dive into the psychological challenges and things to look out for with
retrospectives.

At work we have a group of people which I'm part of that work on making sure
we have good frameworks in place for blameless postmortems and organizational
learning as a whole. Part of that is moving past only investigating failure
(via postmortems) and also look into investigating successes (via
retrospectives). So in a similar way to how I've spent time understanding the
unhelpful concept of human error, I wanted to learn more about the theoretical
concepts of successful retrospectives. Unfortunately this was completely the
wrong book for this. It is a great and very practical read for retrospectives
in the agile sense and how to run successful meetings in general. However I
wasn't looking for that so I constantly kept thinking when we are going to
dive into the meaty, theoretical stuff. This is in no way the authors fault
and I would highly recommend the book as inspiration for improving your
meetings. But for the theoretical underpinnings of retrospectives as an
organizational learning tool I'm still on the lookout. Let me know if you have
recommendations :).
