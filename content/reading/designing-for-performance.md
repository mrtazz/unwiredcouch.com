My coworker [Lara]()[lara]() wrote this book last year and it was a lot of fun
watching her process and how she knocked out that book. Since then it was on
my list of books to read. Especially since I tend to shy away from frontend
things in my day job and want to get better at not doing that. The book is a
wonderful introduction into web performance especially from a design view. It
gives very solid technical details on a lot of things like browser rendering
and image formats that I only had very superficial knowledge of before. I
really enjoyed it and the book lead me to [reduce the page weight of this blog
by 92%](https://unwiredcouch.com/2015/07/24/frontend-performance.html) which
was tons of fun to do as well.
