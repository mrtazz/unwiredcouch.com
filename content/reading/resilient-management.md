This book is a must have regardless whether you are a manager, want to become a manager, reporting to a manager, or just in general work with other humans. Lara Hogan puts down so much useful insights and wonderfully helpful guiding questions and suggestions that I don’t think there is anyone who wouldn’t benefit from reading it. The common thread throughout the whole book is understanding humans and using that to be effective at work (and to be honest also outside). Be it mentoring, coaching, sponsoring, providing (and receiving) feedback, or communication. Every chapter is written with humans in mind. And that is what makes this such an outstanding book. It’s to the point, clearly written, and extremely actionable. You can start reading this book on Friday and will be better equipped to do your job on Monday.
