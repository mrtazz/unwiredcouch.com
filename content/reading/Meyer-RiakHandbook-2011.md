I read this book some time in early 2012 shortly after moving to New York
City. It was a staple on my Kindle while exploring the subway system, parks,
and coffee shops in a new city.

The Riak handbook is a great overview over one of the most popular and
sophisticated NoSQL databases during the early 2010s. The book guides you
through a number of easy to follow examples to learn all the basic properties
of Riak. It uses JavaScript as an easy accessible language to understand the
examples. It shows that Mathias has done deep research into the database and
has put a lot of effort into creating an accessible resource to learn Riak.
