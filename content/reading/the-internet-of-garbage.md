In this book Sarah Jeong - a journalist trained as a lawyer at Harvard Law School - talks about the problem of online harassment. It's another short but really good one. I've learned a ton about copyright law and the limitations of current legislation when it comes to online harassment. But also things that
do work and what things could be attempted. It's a very sobering look at the current state of social networks, online harassment and tooling and legislation to help fight it. Definitely worth a read if you spend any time on the internet.
