I had this book on my reading list for years at this point and never quite got
to it. I actually already had it on my Kindle in like 2015 or so and then
bought a paper copy a couple of years ago after I had gotten rid of the
Kindle. So this year I finally made the time to read it. And I super enjoyed
it. It gives a very good theoretical framework to think about design and how
to distinguish good from bad design. It goes also goes into detail on a range
of other topics like human biases, the business of design, and the role of
feedback and discoverability in design. I took a lot of notes while reading
this book and it let me look at design in a very different light.
