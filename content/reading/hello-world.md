I had this book on my shelf since 2020 or so and never took the time to read
it. With the renewed (and intensified) hype around AI this year I started to
read it even though I wasn’t sure if there was really more about machine
learning that I wanted to know and would find interesting.

But truth be told I really enjoyed reading this book. It’s roughly divided into
topical areas like justice, medicine, cars, and art and discusses the status
quo (as of 2020) as well as improvements and downsides to the rise of usage of
algorithms in general but also machine learning. The author takes a very
nuanced look at all these and it actually made me feel less frustrated about
using computers in some areas than I had been through the public discussions of
AI this year. Highly recommend the book.
