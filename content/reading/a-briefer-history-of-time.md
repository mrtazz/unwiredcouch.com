I decided to read this new edition of "A Brief History of Time", which I had started but never finished. I really enjoyed it even though most of it went totally over my head. I read this book on the Kindle and mostly before going to sleep. Which is not a good combination for reading a book with such an intense topic. I bought it a second time as a paperback and will probably reread it on paper some time soon.
