After years of following Hollnagel's work and having read [ETTO][1] many years
ago, I finally read this (now) classic that he wrote in 2014. And I have to
say it still holds up extremely well even 10 years later. It's a mostly easy
read that introduces and explains concepts from the approach that is branded
in the book as "Safety I", which is the focus on preventing accidents versus
what he calls "Safety II", the focus on fostering and increasing things that
go right. There's a lot in this book about the history of safety and risk
management and how we got to this focus on accidents as the data point to
fixate on. It's a fairly quick read and I can highly recommend it if you do
anything related to safety, risk, or resilience management or even just work
in an area where you are responsible for operating any form of live system.
