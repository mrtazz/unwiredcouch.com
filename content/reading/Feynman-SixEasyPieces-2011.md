This book was a very fun read. I've read a bunch of physics related books in
the last couple of years. And while I don't claim to deeply understand any of
it, the topic still keeps being interesting to me. The way the book is
structured and the lectures are delivered is also very engaging. One of my
favourite parts being the relation of physics to other sciences which is
outlined as relationship of building on each others knowledge and feeding back
information that can be useful to further progress. Rather than what's often
communicated as physics being "the most fundamental science". It was
refreshing to hear that from such a renowned physicists like Feynman.
