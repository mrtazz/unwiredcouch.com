This is a really great introduction to systems thinking. Meadows does a great
job describing basic system properties, adding examples to illustrate them and
then coming back to them later when describing related properties. A lot of
the described things - especially at the beginning - almost seem like common
sense and suddenly you're neck deep in systems thinking. I especially liked
how she puts systems thinking into relation to being a mindful person. That
it's always a model and not the real world and that we still have to act as
morale humans. Highly recommended.
