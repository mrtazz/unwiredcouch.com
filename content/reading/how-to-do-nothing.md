This was one of those books that I started reading with a lot of expectations
that it would be similar to [Digital Minimalism](../digital-minimalism)
and tell me a lot of things that I already kinda knew. But I was completely
surprised by it. The book is much more about what to do _instead_ of following
the pull of the attention economy, rather than why it's bad. There is some of
that in there as well of course. However the fascinating part of the book is
much more the fact that it kinda acts like a nice guide about how to re-engage
with your physical surroundings, your city, countryside, and neighborhood. The
real things around you. It took me a while to realize that and read the book
with that in mind. And I definitely struggled early on as there was way more
talk about the dropout communities of the 70s that I really was interested in.
But after finishing the book I definitely have a new-found appreciation of my
neighborhood and the nature around me. It was a very positive read and in the
end not really about "doing nothing"
