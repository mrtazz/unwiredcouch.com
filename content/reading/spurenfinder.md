I read this as a kind of in between book while I was reading something else.
But I already liked the author and we were thinking about gifting this book so
I wanted to read it first to know what it's about. And I really enjoyed it.
It's a great fantasy story suitable for children around the age of 10-12. It
has some scary parts but is overall very joyous and entertaining.
