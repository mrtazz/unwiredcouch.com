I enjoyed reading this book thoroughly. I've been living in Germany almost all
of my life and yet most of the things I have read and have influenced my
thinking around topics like integration, diversity, migration, race,
discrimination, and related topics have been in English and often centered on
the US. It was really interesting and good to read a book about the topic in
German by a German author who also has the background of being German. It's a
quick but deep and thought provoking book that touches on many topics around
how categories are erected to try and tightly define people and their being.
Can definitely recommend reading it.
