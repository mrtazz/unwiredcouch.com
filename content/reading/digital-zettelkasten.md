I read this as I was working on figuring out how to set up my Zettelkasten and
how it would best serve me after reading the basics of the theory behind it in
[How to Take Smart Notes](../how-to-take-smart-notes). And there sadly
wasn't much new stuff in the book that I haven't already read in various forms
in some blog posts over the last couple of months. However it was really nice
to have this information all in one place in book form. And get the
confirmation that I am on the right track with how I'm building my
Zettelkasten. Or at least going in the same direction that has worked for
others so far as well.
