I super enjoyed this book. I've been to Tunisia as a kid and Cape Town for
giving a talk at a conference before but my knowledge of Africa is still very
limited and I was really curious to learn more. The book is very well written
with a lot of no-nonsense historical details and tons of humor. I learned a lot
about the history of the continent as well as some of it countries and culture.
Can highly recommend this book.
