With democracy currently having a much rougher time and being attacked in many
ways, I was really intrigued by this book. The author touches on many
different subjects that relate to democracy like the power of the people,
elections, demagogues, women's rights to participate and much more. I really
liked reading about the history of democracy and the various "implementations"
and differences around the world. I don't know what I wanted to get out of the
book and I think while I was reading I was yearning for a simple answer to
have to "save" democracy in our current times. Which of course isn't in there.
But I can still recommend the book.
