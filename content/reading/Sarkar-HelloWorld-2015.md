I found this book through [Camille][1] tweeting about the fact that she was
also interviewed for it. "You had me at 'Hellow  World'" is a collection of
interviews with industry leaders from successful companies about the many
aspects of leadership and mentoring. It's a pretty lightweight read and a
great resource to get some insight how successful people talk about those
topics. It does a great job in conveying how important skills outside of
writing code are. And it provides good examples of how to use those for your
advantage.
