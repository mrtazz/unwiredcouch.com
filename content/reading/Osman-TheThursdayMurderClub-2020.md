I had this on my shelf for forever and always wanted to read it and never got
to it. And with there being a Netflix show now that looks like fun, I really
wanted to read the book first. And I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The
book was very funny and entertaining and a kind of different take on a crime
novel in many ways. I can super recommend it.
