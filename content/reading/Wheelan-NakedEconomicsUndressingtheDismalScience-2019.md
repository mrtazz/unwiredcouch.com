I go this book originally because I wanted to start getting a better
understanding of economics as a field. Something I've shied away from through
most of my university years because it was hardly ever talked about in a way
that wasn't either extremely obnoxious or extremely boring. Reading through
the book I kinda alternated between "yes this seems obvious" or "they are
doing what??" depending on the topic. But in general it's very well written
and does a good job conveying economic ideas in plain English that is easy to
understand. The chapters generally are structured in a way that first
it is emphasized that ideally the market shouldn't be regulated and then
following up on this with a more nuanced explanation of why regulation and
government influence and rule making still is needed to some extent for the
whole thing to work. I would definitely recommend it even though even though I
felt triggered a couple of times early in chapters before the more nuanced
progression took place :).
