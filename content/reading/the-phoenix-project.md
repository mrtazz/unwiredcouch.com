I originally started reading it in 2013 when it came out and I enjoyed it back then. But I somehow still dropped the ball and stopped reading it. I finally went back and finished it this summer. It's a good and interesting read and having worked in traditional plant production companies I liked a lot of the parallels in there. It gets a little weird at the end and the last quarter feels like the authors really had to wrap up the book. And no matter how you
look at it, it's definitely business romanticism. But if you don't mind that, it's definitely entertaining.
