I was really curious about this book as I've been thinking a lot lately about
my use of technology, the amount of data that is tracked on devices, and just
the general state of software (and hardware) where a lot things seem to be
getting developed more for the purpose of keeping people hooked and
participating in a closed platform rather than mostly offering a useful service
or a solution to an actual problem. The book overall is definitely a
challenging read at times as it's often written in fairly academic language
(the disclaimer here being that English isn't my first language and I don't
have a degree in the humanities, so ymmv) which made me re-read some sentences
occasionally to get to the gist of it. But overall it was a really interesting
book that gave me a lot of new ideas and avenues to think about my relationship
with technology.
