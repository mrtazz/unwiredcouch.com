I absolutely enjoyed this book and devoured it in 2 days or so. Janna Levin has a fantastically fun and entertaining way to talk about the most fascinating things. And black holes sure are fascinating. There were a lot of parts in the book where I was sure I'm not getting quite the importance of the implications she explained. Or even the science on the highest of levels. But I enjoy thinking about space. And the book did exactly that.
