This book was just plain amazing. I didn’t know what to expect when I found this at the book store and I was reading books about (quantum) physics at the time, so I was curious to see that Heisenberg had written a book. A lot of the (quantum) physics details went over my head. But I loved the discussion of its implications on “reality” and the philosophy of being. It’s an extremely dense read but I got so much out of it.
