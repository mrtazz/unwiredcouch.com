I really enjoyed this book. Mostly because I rarely have read any texts, let alone feminist ones from a Muslim women perspective. There's a lot of things I learned having previously had close to no knowledge of Islam, its traditions, or which are practiced. The book is very UK centric as most of the essay authors live there. So I'm curious to also read more from authors from other places.
