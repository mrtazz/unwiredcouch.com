This is another one I started in 2013 and then dropped for no real reason. I finished it this year and thoroughly enjoyed it. I knew before I started reading that I fall on the introvert side of the scale but the book really helped recognizing some more patterns and making me feel better about it. This is also the only book I finished as a Kindle audiobook and while I likely won't do it again, it was an interesting experience. It's a great read and definitely recommended for anyone who works with other humans in their daily life.
