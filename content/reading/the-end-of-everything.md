This was an absolutely wonderful and mind blowing book to read. I had to think a lot of “Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs” while reading it. I feared at first that it would be too depressing. But the author has an absolutely enjoyable writing style and it made the whole topic fun and interesting rather than loom and doom.
