I read this as I was working on figuring out how to set up my Zettelkasten and
how it would best serve me after reading the basics of the theory behind it in
[Taking Smart Notes][1]. And there sadly wasn't much new stuff in the
book that I haven't already read in various forms in some blog posts over the
last couple of months. However it was really nice to have this information all
in one place in book form. And get the confirmation that I am on the right
track with how I'm building my Zettelkasten. Or at least going in the same
direction that has worked for others so far as well.
