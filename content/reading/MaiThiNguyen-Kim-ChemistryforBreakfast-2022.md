I really like these kind of "quick lessons in science" style books where
different chapters talk about a specific topic. And this book is no
difference. The basic setup is a day in the author's life where everyday
things like drinking coffee, brushing teeth, or charging the phone are being
used to illustrate the chemistry behind how it works and debunk some common
misconceptions along the way. The book is very entertaining and an absolute
fun and educating read.
