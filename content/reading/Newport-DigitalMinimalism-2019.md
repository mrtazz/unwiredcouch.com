It took me quite a while after buying this book to find the excitement to
actually read it. Which had nothing to do with the book itself but the fact
that I was already sold on the concept of "Digital Minimalism" and thought
there wouldn’t be new or interesting things for me in there.

However once I started reading the book I immediately got sucked in and really
enjoyed it. The book is very well researched and there are a lot of references
to other works and research that are interesting to follow up on. It also
contains a good mix of background information and actionable things to do for
minimizing digital factors in once life. That makes it really easy (and
somewhat also creates the desire to try) to give the exercises for
minimization a spin.

My fear of already being sold on the concept and thus the book feeling like
preaching to me as the choir were completely unfounded. If anything I got a
confirmation and reaffirmation to my own practices of minimizing digital
influences on my life.
