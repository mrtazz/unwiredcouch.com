This was a $3 Kindle purchase before I got on a flight. And with the uptick in
popularity of the Go programming language I thought it would be a good thing
to learn about it. I don’t generally enjoy reading programming books but
rather learn by trying to write some code. But this book did a good job of
guiding me through the language and I felt pretty confident in diving in and
giving it a try. Definitely more than worth the money.
