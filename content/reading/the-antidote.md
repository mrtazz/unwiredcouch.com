I found this at the bookstore and bought it on a whim since I had already read his book 4000 weeks and really liked it. "The Antidote" starts with making fun of "positivity seminars" and explains why forbidden yourself to think about something doesn't work. And then gives a kind of all around summary of some of the ways people have dealt with hard topics like pain, negative outcomes of events, inevitability, and death. And still managed to be happy (for whatever that means). There are some well known approaches like stoicism and Buddhism explained in there and even approaches to specifically death like the "day of the dead" celebrations in Mexico. Some of these weren't new to me so I kinda knew what to expect there but the book still was very entertaining and interesting and a good read.
