I’ve known about this book for a while now, but up until early 2015 it was only available in print. And since I don’t really like owning physical books and read exclusively on my Kindle and iPhone I hadn’t bought it yet. So when I found out there is a Kindle version now, I immediately bought it. As expected, the book is really good and gives a good primer on feminism and the historical context from the author’s perspective. It reads less extreme to me as Greer which is very much in line with Hooks’ other writing. Definitely highly recommended for learning more about feminism.

> Feminism is a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression.
