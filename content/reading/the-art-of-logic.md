I wanted this book to be better. The logic part was mostly great. But the author kept jumping between theory and examples way too frequently for my taste. She also rarely used lighter “introductory” examples. But most of the time jumped straight into heavy examples around racism, sexism, and other topics like that. It's one of those books that could have been a blog post.
