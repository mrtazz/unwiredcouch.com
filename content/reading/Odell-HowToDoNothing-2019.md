This was one of those books that I started reading with a lot of expectations
that it would be similar to [Newport's Digital Minimalism][1] and tell me a
lot of things that I already kinda knew. But I was completely surprised by it.
The book is much more about what to do _instead_ of following the pull of the
attention economy, rather than why it's bad. There is some of that in there as
well of course. However the fascinating part of the book is much more the fact
that it kinda acts like a nice guide about how to re-engage with your physical
surroundings, your city, countryside, and neighborhood. The real things around
you. It took me a while to realize that and read the book with that in mind.
And I definitely struggled early on as there was way more talk about the
dropout communities of the 70s that I really was interested in. But after
finishing the book I definitely have a new-found appreciation of my
neighborhood and the nature around me. It was a very positive read and in the
end not really about "doing nothing"
