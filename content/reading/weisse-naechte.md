I decided to give this book a try after poking around at the local book store. I realized I’ve never read a single Dostoyevsky. And I sure wasn’t gonna read “War & Peace” just to give it a try and see how I like it. After some quick googling it seemed like “Weiße Nächte” was one of his fairly popular works, and they had it in the [Reclam][1] version which is about 4 Euros. So not a huge investment.

So I read the whole thing with not a lot of expectations. And overall I didn’t hate it. It was slightly obnoxious at times, and Dostoyevsky seems to definitely have a thing for drama. Plus it has all the problems you can expect from a man during the 19th century when it comes to respecting women. The ending made up for a lot though.
