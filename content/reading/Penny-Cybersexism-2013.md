This short book by Laurie Penny is a very good read about sexism in the age of
social networks and the omnipresent Internet. It does a great job at talking
about how a lot of familiar concepts of "offline sexism" are reinvented online
and no news to women. It's short and insightful enough to recommend reading it
without hesitation.
