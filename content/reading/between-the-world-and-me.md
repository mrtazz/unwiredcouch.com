This was an absolutely fantastic, emotional, gut-wrenching, sad,  and happy book to read. I've come to really like the way it is written, as a conversation between the author and his son, trying to explain the world. There's a lot of mixing of history, current affairs, personal history and memories, which makes for a very personal piece of literature.
