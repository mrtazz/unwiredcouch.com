In the same spirit that made me read [Naked Economics][1] I had also asked a
friend who's an economist whether he knew any good books to learn the basics
about economics but also specifically about the "Schuldenbremse", Germany's
[balanced budget amendment][2] flippantly called "debt brake". So he
recommended me Bajohr's essay on the topic which ended up a very brief but
interesting read. The author collects a good amount of history on the topic
and how it came to be and then goes on to outline his critique of it and how
it doesn't help in many cases and in others even makes things worse. It is
written in a very accessible way even for someone like me who's not super well
versed in economics terms and theories. I can highly recommend it if you want
to learn about this topic that was a huge contributing factor in the failing
of the last German government.
