I randomly found this book at the bookstore and was very curious about it.
I've been trying to make regular time for reading throughout the last couple
of years and it's often a pull between reading time and all the chores and
distractions that also exist. So I was really curious about this book in a
kind of meta way. The author approaches the topic of reading from a number of
angles and first and foremost clears up the ever lasting cliche of there being
"good" or "proper" books to read and lesser ones. He encourages reading on a
whim (or Whim as he defines it) that which one is curious about. And actively
shuns reading list that should be worked through. Probably owed to the fact
that the author is a literature academic the book feels fairly intellectual at
times. But overall I really enjoyed the book and it made me want to read even
more.
