I wasn’t quite sure if I agree with using cucumber for integration testing of
configuration management. And after reading the book I still don’t. It’s hard
to draw the line where you just test the implementation of the config
management framework versus your own business logic. And I think it’s highly
dependent on the level of advanced logic in your config management code.
Although I definitely have seen code that would benefit from some testing like
that.
