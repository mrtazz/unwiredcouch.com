I got this recommend by a friend as I had just finished [City of Bones][1] and
wanted something similar in some regards.  And the fact that it was set on the
backdrop on some old Russian folk stories was kinda interesting. And overall
the book really held up. The first 100 pages were really slow, mostly
depressing, and I wasn't able to really keep track of the characters. But
after that I was really drawn into the story, to the point where some parts I
found creepy enough that I stopped reading it before going to bed and read it
in daylight instead 😅. I finished the final 150 pages or so in one setting
because I really wanted to know how it ends. And then immediately ordered the
two follow up books in the series.
