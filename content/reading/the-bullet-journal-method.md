Very nice and easy read. Made me really think about slowing down for planning and reflection. I read this book after having switched to a Bullet Journal for daily logging and planning about 9 months prior. And it’s really easy to get sucked into all the pretty and elaborate spreads with bullet journaling and lose focus of what’s really important. The book does a really good job focusing on the fundamentals with bullet journaling and how to think about what to incorporate into your journaling practice.
