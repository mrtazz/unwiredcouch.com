I found this at the bookstore and bought it on a whim since I had already read
his book 4000 weeks and really liked it. "The Antidote" starts with making fun
of "positivity seminars" and explains why forbidden yourself to think about
something doesn't work. And then gives a kind of all around summary of some of
the ways people have dealt with hard topics like pain, negative outcomes of
events, inevitability, and death. And still managed to be happy (for whatever
that means). There are some well known approaches like stoicism and Buddhism
explained in there and even approaches to specifically death like the "day of
the dead" celebrations in Mexico. Some of these weren't new to me so I kinda
knew what to expect there but the book still was very entertaining and
interesting and a good read.
