I saw this book in my regular bookstore and the topic really interested me. So
I started reading the book with no preconception or notion of who the author
was. Only halfway through or so I found out she also has a somewhat popular
YouTube channel.

Reading the book was a bit of a split for me. The author definitely does a
good job (as far as I can tell) explaining physics concepts and theories in a
way that is understandable and with the given topic in mind. And the fact that
the book is structured as chapters where each answers a specific question also
makes it a really quick and interesting read. However there have also been
parts of the book where the tone bordered on obnoxious for me with the cliche
undertone (or sometimes even explicit statement) that eventually everything
can “just” be explained with physics and how - in the author’s view - many
people (even other scientists) are incorrect in their assumptions and world
views. Which I find more jarring than entertaining. But the core idea in the
book that there are some views (e.g. the existence of a god) that are neither
scientific nor un-scientific as they can’t be proven or disproven. But rather
a-scientific as they are compatible with current science since nothing we
currently know confirms or refutes them. I’ve found this to be a really good
frame for thinking about the world. Overall I enjoyed the book with some
caveats.
