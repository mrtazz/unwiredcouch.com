This was an interesting read about the author's perspective on the issues of
objectification and discrimination of women and their bodies. There are a lot
of interesting arguments in there about how much in the current economy (and
the general status quo) really relies on maintaining that women stay in this
place and how badly women suffer through this. Especially as a cis-man I can
highly recommend reading the book to get a perspective on a lot of issues that
at least I didn't think about that much before.
