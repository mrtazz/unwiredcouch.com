Hi! I'm Daniel!

This is my little space on the internet where I publish thoughts, ideas, art,
things I read and lots of other stuff that comes to mind.

Although I have reduced my usage of various (social) websites over the years
you can find me as `mrtazz` on a lot of them like
[Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@mrtazz) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/mrtazz).

I write about a lot of things on this blog, but it doesn't and has never
represented the opinion of any of my employers.
