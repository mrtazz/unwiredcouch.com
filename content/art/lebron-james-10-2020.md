LeBron James sketch. Pencil on toned paper. This started as a loose
underdrawing for a painting. Then I decided to tighten the pencils a bit more
and now I don’t know anymore if I want to paint over it 😂.
.

But still decided to color it a couple of days later. Watercolor and
watercolor pencils. And a little bit of ink for some small details. That
counts for #inktober, right? 😆
