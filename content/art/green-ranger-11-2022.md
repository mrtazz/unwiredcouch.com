RIP Jason David Frank

I very much still remember the emotions those Saturday mornings when the Green
Ranger showed up and first wrecked havoc to the Rangers, summoning his Zord
with the dagger flute, before finally joining the good side and the Power
Rangers to fight evil and eventually becoming the White Ranger. I seems a bit
silly now writing it all out all these years later. But back then it blew my
kid brain and was the main topic of many debates on the school yard. Thanks
for everything!
