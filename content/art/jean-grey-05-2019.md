Finally done with this teen Jean Grey piece I’ve tried to finish for a while
now. Absolutely inspired by @el_vic_ibanez_’s Jean Grey. One of my fav
characters and I loved her standalone run as well as her Generations issue.
Swipe for some process pics and my desk with a @jimlee stream in the
background which always inspires me to just draw.
