dramatic Splinter

I would definitely watch a TMNT show about a younger Splinter pre-Turtles that
just runs around a does badass ninja stuff. Got inspired for this by the
recent absolutely amazing @bosslogic Metal Gear Solid cyborg ninja posts for
the MGS anniversary. And thought which other popular fighters would fit such a
pose.
