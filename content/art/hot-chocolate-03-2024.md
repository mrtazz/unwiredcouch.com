Quick watercolor sketch while watching TV. I tend to focus on people a lot
with my art so I wanted to do something different where I'd mostly practice
values. The reference is from [Watercolor
Affair](https://www.watercoloraffair.com/how-to-paint-complex-subjects/) but I
decided to not follow the tutorial and try out where I'd end up by myself
instead.
