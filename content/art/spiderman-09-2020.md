2018 vs 2020. To the week 2 years ago I decided that I wanted to learn how to
draw with basically no idea how to do it. I watched a ton of @jimlee stream
videos on YouTube and in that first week I drew the bottom Spider-Man sketch
and it took me about 3 hours. Since then art has become such a big part of my
life and one of the most joyful hobbies I’ve ever had. I’ve tried out so many
mediums, discovered artists and their wonderful art, and learned to appreciate
comic books in a completely new way. I decided to redraw the sketch how I
would do it today (and in about an hour). It’s too easy to think I’ve not
learned anything in the last 2 years when drawings don’t turn out the way I
want. But this exercise really made me realize how far I’ve come, even if I
know how far I still want to go.
