Because art should be fun here’s a hyper realist painting of
[@roidrage](https://paperplanes.de) in celebration of his recent forays into
woodworking and the forest.  Also I never thought „shirtless lumberjack“ would
end up in my search history.  Done in watercolor and gouache on Clairefontaine
mixed media paper.
