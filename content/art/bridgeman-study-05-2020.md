Anatomy studies after George Bridgman. I’ve been watching the
[@stevehustonartist](https://www.instagram.com/stevehustonartist/) course on
sketchbooking on @newmastersacademy and was immediately hooked. I got a
scrapbook and filled my @lamy_official joy with bronze ink. And it’s been very
enjoyable to just experiment and learn and worry less about feeling like I
need to “finish” something.
