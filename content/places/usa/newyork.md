I've lived in New York City from 2011 - 2017 and absolutely loved it. It's one
of my absolutely favourite cities in the world.


### Coffee

#### [Sweetleaf](https://www.sweetleafcoffee.com/)

A regular spot for coffee and quick snacks. They mostly have sweet stuff and
the location and coffee is great.



### Food

#### [Peter Pan's Donuts](https://www.peterpandonuts.com/)

I used to live on the block of Peter Pan's Donuts and definitely ate way too
many donuts during that time. They have both bagels and donuts in the classic
varieties and definitely recommend going there.

#### [Eagle Trading Company](http://www.eagletradingco.nyc/)

I used to live close by this place and had breakfast there every weekend
basically. They have a variety of really good sandwiches and decent coffee.
And the atmosphere and staff is great.


#### [Black Forest Brooklyn](https://www.blackforestbrooklyn.com/)

German food in Brooklyn and it's as legit as it gets. Coming here for food
really felt like coming home. I don't remember if there are many vegan options
but the Schnitzel is great.

#### [Smorgasburg](https://www.smorgasburg.com/)

The Smorgasburg open air food market in Williamsburg always has a great mix of
different things to try. It's generally pretty crowded but worth it to find a
variety of food things to try.

### Parks and Outdoor Spaces

#### [Prospect Park](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/B073/)

Prospect Park is a pretty well known park in Brooklyn and rightfully so. It's
pretty big and really nice to walk with lots of bike riding options.



#### [Highline](https://www.thehighline.org/)

The High Line is a nice park to walk built on a historic, elevated rail line.


### Misc

#### [East River Ferry](https://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/east-river/)

I used to take the ferry to work every day and it was the best commute I ever
had. Especially on sunny days it's such a great view along the Manhattan
skyline and the Brooklyn waterfront.
