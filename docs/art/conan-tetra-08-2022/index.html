I gave sketching my version of a Conan panel from the one book I had as a kid
a try. Swipe to see the original and the cover of the book. It was the only
Conan book I had as a kid but I devoured it and was fascinated by the stories.
So I wanted to see how it would look like if I gave it a try. I took some
inspiration for Conan from @mahmudasrar’s version
(his art is amazing and a constant inspiration for me to get better) but tried
to still stay close to the original.
