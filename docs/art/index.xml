with my art so I wanted to do something different where I&rsquo;d mostly practice
values. The reference is from <a href="https://www.watercoloraffair.com/how-to-paint-complex-subjects/">Watercolor
Affair</a> but I
decided to not follow the tutorial and try out where I&rsquo;d end up by myself
instead.</p>

      <description>RIP Jason David Frank
I very much still remember the emotions those Saturday mornings when the Green Ranger showed up and first wrecked havoc to the Rangers, summoning his Zord with the dagger flute, before finally joining the good side and the Power Rangers to fight evil and eventually becoming the White Ranger.</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RIP Jason David Frank</p>
<p>I very much still remember the emotions those Saturday mornings when the Green
Ranger showed up and first wrecked havoc to the Rangers, summoning his Zord
with the dagger flute, before finally joining the good side and the Power
Rangers to fight evil and eventually becoming the White Ranger. I seems a bit
silly now writing it all out all these years later. But back then it blew my
kid brain and was the main topic of many debates on the school yard. Thanks
for everything!</p>

<p>I would definitely watch a TMNT show about a younger Splinter pre-Turtles that
just runs around a does badass ninja stuff. Got inspired for this by the
recent absolutely amazing @bosslogic Metal Gear Solid cyborg ninja posts for
the MGS anniversary. And thought which other popular fighters would fit such a
pose.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I gave sketching my version of a Conan panel from the one book I had as a kid
a try. Swipe to see the original and the cover of the book. It was the only
Conan book I had as a kid but I devoured it and was fascinated by the stories.
So I wanted to see how it would look like if I gave it a try. I took some
inspiration for Conan from <a href="https://mahmudasrar.com/">@mahmudasrar’s</a> version
(his art is amazing and a constant inspiration for me to get better) but tried
to still stay close to the original.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Beverly Crusher, Star Trek TNG. It’s been hard to find time for art
lately. And the more I don’t do it the more I stress myself about having to
make something really good to make it count. So today I just took my art
supplies while watching TV and decided to see what happens. And I don’t hate
it 😬.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Columbo. This started as a traditional quick sketch on paper while watching
TV. And then I was too lazy to get my watercolors and colored this in
procreate with mostly the watercolor brush. I generally have a hard time with
creating digital art (I just enjoy traditional more). But this approach
inspired by @schmoedraws’ process she shared on her Patreon really worked for
me.

counts for #inktober, right? 😆

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2018 vs 2020. To the week 2 years ago I decided that I wanted to learn how to
draw with basically no idea how to do it. I watched a ton of @jimlee stream
videos on YouTube and in that first week I drew the bottom Spider-Man sketch
and it took me about 3 hours. Since then art has become such a big part of my
life and one of the most joyful hobbies I’ve ever had. I’ve tried out so many
mediums, discovered artists and their wonderful art, and learned to appreciate
comic books in a completely new way. I decided to redraw the sketch how I
would do it today (and in about an hour). It’s too easy to think I’ve not
learned anything in the last 2 years when drawings don’t turn out the way I
want. But this exercise really made me realize how far I’ve come, even if I
know how far I still want to go.</p>

But all the cool art happening around this game is really incredible. These
are some fountain pen and white watercolor pencil sketches done while watching
TV.</p>

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/stevehustonartist/">@stevehustonartist</a> course on
sketchbooking on @newmastersacademy and was immediately hooked. I got a
scrapbook and filled my @lamy_official joy with bronze ink. And it’s been very
enjoyable to just experiment and learn and worry less about feeling like I
need to “finish” something.</p>
