Columbo. This started as a traditional quick sketch on paper while watching
TV. And then I was too lazy to get my watercolors and colored this in
procreate with mostly the watercolor brush. I generally have a hard time with
creating digital art (I just enjoy traditional more). But this approach
inspired by @schmoedraws’ process she shared on her Patreon really worked for
me.
