        <h2> <a href=""> My Coffee Setup </a></h2>

        <p>In early 2011 I had finished university (again) and decided that I didn&rsquo;t want
to drink bad coffee anymore. So I started to look into the basics of how to
make good coffee. I started with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Skerton-Storage-Capacity/dp/B001802PIQ">hand grinder</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press">French
Press</a>. I quickly realized that I don&rsquo;t like the oily taste and
got an <a href="http://www.aeropress.com/">Aeropress</a>. By the time I had moved to NYC with only my
Aeropress and grinder, my friend [Mathias][roidrage] had published his <a href="http://holgarific.net/2011/12/05/the-beginners-shopping-guide-to-filter-coffee-gear/">&ldquo;The
Beginnerâ€™s Shopping Guide to Filter Coffee Gear&rdquo;</a> which I used to
restock my kitchen. Since then I&rsquo;ve switched out some things and settled on
some others and this page is the place where I write down my current setup.</p>
<h3 id="at-home">At Home</h3>
<h4 id="grinder">Grinder</h4>
<p>I used to use a hand grinder at home to make my coffee. As I was mostly making
coffee for one person anyways, it wasn&rsquo;t such a big deal. But especially for
<a href="https://github.com/roidrage/coffee/pull/2">cold brew</a> it got really annoying. So I bought an electric grinder
and settled for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Conical-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B00LW8122Y">Baratza Encore</a> there. It&rsquo;s a good tradeoff
between quality, usability and price. The most important point for me there
was that it has a burr grinder, thus resulting in a more consistent grind.</p>
<h4 id="brew-tools">Brew tools</h4>
<p>90% of the time I make coffee with the <a href="http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/">Chemex</a> at home. It&rsquo;s overall
my favourite way of brewing coffee as it is pretty easy and doesn&rsquo;t take
overly long. For the Chemex I usually go with a 7gr coffee/100ml water ratio.
I use that as the base from which I calculate how much coffee grounds I need
for the amount of coffee I want. I usually make either 300, 400 or 700ml of
coffee depending on the number of people participating. My brewing process is
based on the <a href="http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/content/iphone-app">Intelligentsia</a> one, so I let it bloom at 50-100ml
of water for about a minute and then slowly pour in the rest. I have the 8-cup
Chemex at home but would probably get the 6-cup one if I had to buy a new one.
I also have a 3-cup one which I keep at the office for when I want to make
coffee for just myself and don&rsquo;t want to pour it all into the cup at once. I
also have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hario-VDC-02W-Ceramic-Coffee-Dripper/dp/B000P4D5HG">Hario v60</a> and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HIC-Filter-Porcelain-Number-12-Cups/dp/B001W6Q53C">HIC cone</a> at home which I don&rsquo;t
use extremely often because I prefer the Chemex. But every now and then I make
a pour over with them and am really happy I have those.</p>
<p><a href="https://instagram.com/p/20oH2Itpx3/"><img src="../../images/coffee/chemex.jpg" alt=""></a>
<a href="https://instagram.com/p/u0hOn3tp3d/"><img src="../../images/coffee/3cupchemex.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And there is also the Aeropress at home still. And I mostly use it for when I
want to make a makeshift cappuccino or an <a href="https://instagram.com/p/5pQa5ONp22/">Iced Aeropress</a>
when it&rsquo;s hot, which is a nice way to have a cool drink without having to go
all the way of making <a href="https://github.com/roidrage/coffee/pull/2">cold brew</a>. For both I use the same ratio,
which is 17gr per 2 Aeropress chambers.</p>
<p>I also have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hario-Buono-Coffee-Drip-Kettle/dp/B000IGOXLS">Hario Buono kettle</a> at home which is great because it
has the swan neck which makes it great for a controlled pour. I also have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UG4UM6">a
scale</a> which I can&rsquo;t say too much about. It&rsquo;s mostly a regular kitchen
scale and it works. If I had to get a new one, I would try to get one with a
longer/adjustable timeout. Often enough it times out while I have the Chemex
on there to measure the water I pour in and then have to remember where I&rsquo;ve
been and how much I still need to pour.</p>
<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>
<h4 id="grinder-1">Grinder</h4>
<p>When I&rsquo;m traveling (which I try to keep carry-on only) I have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Porlex-Mini-Stainless-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B0044ZA066">Porlex
mini</a> grinder with me. It has a big enough chamber for one person and
it fits into the Aeropress so it takes up even less space. I used to travel
with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Skerton-Storage-Capacity/dp/B001802PIQ">Hario Skerton</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hario-Coffee-Mill-Slim-Grinder/dp/B001804CLY">Hario mini mill</a>. They
are both great grinders. However the skerton doesn&rsquo;t have a cover so the beans
constantly spill out while grinding and the mini mill is slightly bigger than
the Porlex so it doesn&rsquo;t fit into the travel gear as nicely and also is made
of mostly plastic which has broken for me before.</p>
<h4 id="brew-tool">Brew Tool</h4>
<p>For brewing coffee while traveling I exclusively use the Aeropress. It doesn&rsquo;t
take up a lot of space and makes great coffee. I bring the lid, the stirrer,
and the scoop with me but often I leave the funnel at home. I also always
bring the <a href="http://www.kaffeologie.com/shop/s-filter-for-aeropress-coffee-makers">Kaffeologie S Filter</a> with me in addition to some paper
filters. I prefer the taste with the paper filters, but I don&rsquo;t want to have
to deal with running out of filters in a foreign city. I don&rsquo;t bring a scale
and I use the kettle you have or can get in most hotels. If there isn&rsquo;t one,
most hotels now have a Keurig machine in the rooms, which makes perfectly fine
hot water if you leave the capsule out. I let it flow into one of the hotel
provided cups and brew the coffee in the other one (thankfully there are
almost always 2).</p>

<h3 id="beans">Beans</h3>
<p>Bean supply is a highly subjective topic and it&rsquo;s where opinions differ the
most. I usually always have a subscription and get some beans in addition from
roasters and coffee shops in my neighborhood. Right now I have a
<a href="http://www.heartroasters.com/">Heart</a> subscription which is wonderful and I used to have a
<a href="http://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/">Squaremile</a> one which was also great. For the additional coffee I
either go with <a href="http://www.tobysestate.com/">Toby&rsquo;s Estate</a>, <a href="http://www.sweetleaflic.com/">Sweet Leaf</a>, or <a href="https://counterculturecoffee.com/">Counter
Culture</a>.</p>
