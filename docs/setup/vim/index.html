        <h1 class="posttitle"> <a href=""> How I vim </a></h1>

        <p>This is an interview I did for &ldquo;How I vim&rdquo; and was originally published
<a href="http://howivim.com/2016/daniel-schauenberg/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-use-vim-for">Who are you and what do you use Vim for?</h3>
<p>My name is Daniel and I&rsquo;m a staff engineer at Etsy on the DevTools team. We
are an infrastructure team that handles things like maintaining the deployment
system and the development environment, the application level metrics stack,
and dev data access. My daily work is a very fun mix of software engineering
and operations type work.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of that I write a lot of Chef, shell scripts, ruby, and PHP.
Outside of work I also write the occasional Go or C++ for some of my open
source projects. For all of this I always use vim, 99% of the time running
inside a tmux session.</p>
<p>I got introduced to vim in 2004 by a friend who showed me around Linux and
UNIX when we were both first semester university students. Back then I didn&rsquo;t
have a preferred editor and as I learned more about Linux I just used vim as
it already was installed on most systems. I very quickly switched from Linux
to FreeBSD and with that from vim to vi (or nvi rather) as the default
installed editor. At that point I hadn&rsquo;t really started using any plugins, so
going from vanilla vim to vi wasn&rsquo;t really a big deal for me. I used it long
enough in that setup that when I got my first Mac and started using editors
like SubEthaEdit, Textmate, and Smultron because I liked their native look and
feel, I had already built up the vim muscle memory. And as I was using gVim on
the Windows machines at work, I kept the muscle memory although I wasn&rsquo;t using
vim on my personal machines. When I went back to grad school I eventually
switched to MacVim. Mostly because Textmate and all the other OS X editors
seemed like abandon ware at the time. And I wanted something I was familiar
with and I knew would stick around. So I decided to go back to vim and go full
in with customizing it to my needs. And now roughly 7 years later vim is
basically the only way I edit text files on a computer. I use it for code,
blogging, journaling, meeting notes, emails (via mutt), and <a href="https://unwiredcouch.com/2015/06/08/accounting-the-unix-way.html">accounting (via
ledger)</a>. I try to use as much of vanilla vim as possible as my job
includes working on a bunch of different servers and I don&rsquo;t want to be slowed
down too much when I don&rsquo;t have my vim config ready. I also try to only use
plugins that are purely written in VimL. That way I don&rsquo;t have to deal with
how to build the right vim on the different platforms (OS X, Linux, FreeBSD)
I&rsquo;m most likely to use it on.</p>
<p>Sadly on the iPhone vim is not a super great choice so I use Editorial there,
mostly for writing blog posts when I don&rsquo;t want to have a laptop open.</p>
<h3 id="introduce-us-to-your-vim-config">Introduce us to your Vim config.</h3>
<p>When I went back to vim I also started using plugins for real. While writing
my undergrad thesis (with vim and latex) I had already started with a super
simple vimrc file I found somewhere and that is still the base of the setup I
use today - 9 years later. When I started adding plugins to my vim setup, some
of the first ones I added were pathogen and fugitive. I also was used to
having tab complete things so I installed supertab. From there I constantly
added and removed some plugins and over the years I&rsquo;ve converged to a dozen or
so plugins that I have installed. I keep them together with my vimrc in a git
repo <a href="https://github.com/mrtazz/vimfiles">on GitHub</a> and I wrote a Makefile that handles installing the
configuration via symlinks and updating and adding plugins via a vim-bundle
script I found somewhere and have downloaded into my ~/bin. The plugins I use
most are the ones that are just enabled in the background and do their thing,
like syntastic, supertab, tabline, or syntax highlighters. I do have some
others to add functionality, like ctrl-p, nerdtree, or VoOM. I do use them
occasionally, but most of the time forget about them. A plugin that falls into
that category but that I use a lot is vim-zenroom2. It creates a writeroom
style focus in vim and I love it for writing. I use it a lot for blog posts,
journaling, meeting notes, or documentation writing.</p>
<p>Another plugin I wrote and use a lot is <a href="https://github.com/mrtazz/vim-stencil">vim-stencil</a>. It provides a
simple way to have templates for vim that you can load into a buffer. It&rsquo;s
inspired by the vim skeleton files and I use it a ton for meeting note
templates, journaling scaffold and weekly planning notes. A nice side effect
of writing emails in mutt is that I can also use it for canned responses. Plus
I can keep all of my templates in git together with my vim config. The plugin
also provides a very basic set of variable expansions for common things like
date or weekday.</p>
<p>I use solarized light as my theme although I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan when it came
out. I used a slightly patched version of molokai for many years. But one day
I realized that I was really annoyed by the different applications I use a lot
in the terminal (regular terminal colors, vim, mut, weechat) all look
different. And I wanted consistency and at the same time switch to a light
theme as it was easier on my eyes. And solarized light was the only one people
had already ported to most applications. So I gave it a real shot and now I
really enjoy it.</p>
<p>Some of the maybe more interesting things in my vimrc is that I have line
numbers turned off. I used them for a long time, then played with relative
line numbers for a bit and then decided that I don&rsquo;t really care about it most
of the time, so I just turned it off. When I really want the current line
number I just look in the statusline. I also have a lot of one off settings
and inline functions in my vimrc. I have a <code>Today()</code> function that inserts the
current date in a specific format and is mapped to <code>,d</code> (, is my leader key).
I use it a ton when writing my work journal or taking notes in meetings. I&rsquo;ve
also inlined the <code>GoFormat</code> function from the deprecated official plugin. They
made <code>vim-go</code> the new official one and it did way too many things for my taste
as I only really wanted automatic formatting for my Go code.</p>
<p>I also activate spelling for a certain set of file types. Funnily I still have
it enabled for <code>.tex</code> files from my university days. But these days the
setting to enable it for markdown and mail (as I use mutt) is what I really
use. As those types of things are mostly read by others (email and
documentation) and written in English which isn&rsquo;t my first language.</p>
<p>Speaking of <a href="https://unwiredcouch.com/2015/08/31/writing-workflow.html">writing in vim</a>. I use it a ton for non programming as
well. And as mentioned I use vim-zenroom for focused writing which depends on
Goyo. In order to make the experience better there I have some Goyo hooks in
my vimrc to close the buffer if it&rsquo;s the last one in Goyo mode and also run a
command to disable the tmux status bar for complete focus.</p>
<p>I also have the arrow keys disabled to force me to use hjkl for navigation. I
did that when I started at Etsy and knew I would be working in vim a lot more
so I decided to train that muscle memory. A side effect of that is that I
enable hjkl navigation support wherever possible in other apps.</p>
<h3 id="what-have-been-the-most-useful-resources-for-you-to-learn-vim">What have been the most useful resources for you to learn Vim?</h3>
<p>I think the most helpful resources have been the vim wikia and random blog
posts when I was researching some specific things like setups for writing or
programming in specific languages.</p>
<p>When it comes to writing plugins, I think I learned the most from reading
<a href="https://github.com/tpope">@tpope&rsquo;s</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mattn">@mattn&rsquo;s</a> code on GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-most-recent-thing-youve-learned-about-vim">What&rsquo;s the most recent thing you&rsquo;ve learned about Vim?</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what the most recent thing is, but something I want to learn
is how to better navigate within text. I do use G, ctrl-d, and ctrl-u a lot
for longer jumps. And I use O/o and A/a and those commands a lot when I know I
want to insert things. However within textblocks or when in visual mode I
still hold down hjkl until the cursor is where I want it to be. I would love
to have a more ingrained understanding of how to jump more efficiently in vim.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-get-started-writing-vim-plugins">How did you get started writing Vim plugins?</h3>
<p>I think my first steps in plugin writing must have been around 2010 when I was
trying to add mustache support to the zencoding vim plugin. I was just
learning about the current state of web development and tried out a lot of
things. I was really into mustache and the idea of writing HTML faster with
zencoding intrigued me. I think I never actually got it working or I sent a
pull request and it didn&rsquo;t get merged and I failed to follow up. But it was
super fun and I learned a lot.</p>
<h3 id="tell-us-about-your-plugin-simplenotevim">Tell us about your plugin simplenote.vim.</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mrtazz/simplenote.vim">simplenote.vim</a> is a plugin that lets you edit and manage
your simplenote notes right from vim. It really grew out of the situation that
I was a big fan of simplenote and it was the only application I used for
writing outside of vim.  So I wanted to see if I couldn&rsquo;t get it working as a
vim plugin and not have to got the route via Dropbox syncing. It was really
mostly a curiosity thing and something I thought would be cool to exist. My
initial plan was to write it completely in vim script. As I me tokens before I
really like having a vim setup that doesn&rsquo;t need any special things compiled
in. And I had a rough version working that used curl for talking to the API
and presented JSON to edit. However when it came to JSON parsing all the
existing solutions were not super intuitive and I needed to somehow make it
easy to install the dependencies for the plugin as I wanted it to be really
easy to use. And then I would still have to write all the API wrapper methods
for the actual API. So I decided to just write a <a href="https://github.com/mrtazz/simplenote.py">python
module</a> for the simplenote API and publish that as well. And
make a strict separation between data access and storage which would be Python
and vim interfacing which would be vim script. I chose Python at the time
because I was already familiar with it and had written a bunch of API wrappers
for different things in it already.</p>
<p>The first version was super barebones and pretty rough, but it was incredibly
fun to write it. The hardest part was probably testing it as I had no idea how
to write unit tests for the vim script part of the plugin. So it was a lot of
editing, putting in echo statements, and opening another vim session to try it
out. I learned a ton about vim&rsquo;s buffer and window model, how to run
concurrent Python inside my editor and how to manage a somewhat popular open
source project.</p>
<p>After a couple of years of using it I stopped as I didn&rsquo;t want to host my (at
times pretty personal) notes on someone else&rsquo;s computer. And as I couldn&rsquo;t
give the project the attention it deserved while not actively using it I
reached out to @atomicules who had been the most active outside contributor at
that point and asked him if he wanted to take over maintenance of the vim
plugin and the Python module. Fortunately he was up for it and so for the last
3 years he has been doing a fantastic job of maintaining and pushing the
project forward.</p>
<h3 id="are-you-involved-in-a-local-vim-community">Are you involved in a local Vim community?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not. For some reason that has never occurred to me.</p>
<h3 id="share-a-snippet-of-vim-script-youve-written-and-talk-about-what-it-does">Share a snippet of Vim script you&rsquo;ve written and talk about what it does.</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>function! Today()
  let today = strftime(&quot;%A %m\/%d\/%Y&quot;)
  exe &quot;normal a&quot;. today
endfunction
command! Today :call Today()
</code></pre><p>This is the snippet I talked about earlier that inserts the current date after
the cursor position. It&rsquo;s pretty simple and yet incredibly useful for me. It
creates a string from the current date formatted as &ldquo;weekday day/month/year&rdquo;
and appends it at the current position. The function is then mapped to a
command with the same name so I can call it as <code>:Today</code> and also map that
command to a leader key combo.</p>
<h3 id="what-have-you-been-working-on-recently-in-vim">What have you been working on recently in Vim?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on a bunch of infrastructure projects at work that
mostly involve writing chef recipes or PHP. I also constantly use vim to
update documentation and write emails.</p>
