    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in New York City from 2011 - 2017 and absolutely loved it. It&rsquo;s one
of my absolutely favourite cities in the world.</p>
<h3 id="coffee">Coffee</h3>
<h4 id="sweetleafhttpswwwsweetleafcoffeecom"><a href="https://www.sweetleafcoffee.com/">Sweetleaf</a></h4>
<p>A regular spot for coffee and quick snacks. They mostly have sweet stuff and
the location and coffee is great.</p>
<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
<h4 id="peter-pans-donutshttpswwwpeterpandonutscom"><a href="https://www.peterpandonuts.com/">Peter Pan&rsquo;s Donuts</a></h4>
<p>I used to live on the block of Peter Pan&rsquo;s Donuts and definitely ate way too
many donuts during that time. They have both bagels and donuts in the classic
varieties and definitely recommend going there.</p>
<h4 id="eagle-trading-companyhttpwwweagletradingconyc"><a href="http://www.eagletradingco.nyc/">Eagle Trading Company</a></h4>
<p>I used to live close by this place and had breakfast there every weekend
basically. They have a variety of really good sandwiches and decent coffee.
And the atmosphere and staff is great.</p>
<h4 id="black-forest-brooklynhttpswwwblackforestbrooklyncom"><a href="https://www.blackforestbrooklyn.com/">Black Forest Brooklyn</a></h4>
<p>German food in Brooklyn and it&rsquo;s as legit as it gets. Coming here for food
really felt like coming home. I don&rsquo;t remember if there are many vegan options
but the Schnitzel is great.</p>
<h4 id="smorgasburghttpswwwsmorgasburgcom"><a href="https://www.smorgasburg.com/">Smorgasburg</a></h4>
<p>The Smorgasburg open air food market in Williamsburg always has a great mix of
different things to try. It&rsquo;s generally pretty crowded but worth it to find a
variety of food things to try.</p>
<h3 id="parks-and-outdoor-spaces">Parks and Outdoor Spaces</h3>
<h4 id="prospect-parkhttpswwwnycgovparksorgparksb073"><a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/B073/">Prospect Park</a></h4>
<p>Prospect Park is a pretty well known park in Brooklyn and rightfully so. It&rsquo;s
pretty big and really nice to walk with lots of bike riding options.</p>
<h4 id="highlinehttpswwwthehighlineorg"><a href="https://www.thehighline.org/">Highline</a></h4>
<p>The High Line is a nice park to walk built on a historic, elevated rail line.</p>
<h3 id="misc">Misc</h3>
<h4 id="east-river-ferryhttpswwwferrynycroutes-and-schedulesrouteeast-river"><a href="https://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/east-river/">East River Ferry</a></h4>
<p>I used to take the ferry to work every day and it was the best commute I ever
had. Especially on sunny days it&rsquo;s such a great view along the Manhattan
skyline and the Brooklyn waterfront.</p>
