        <h1 class="posttitle"> <a href=""> Static URL shortening with nginx maps </a></h1>

        <p>In 2012 when it was hip and cool to do so, I also had my own URL shortener. It
was based on what I called <a href="https://github.com/mrtazz/katana">&ldquo;katana&rdquo;</a>, a
convenience ruby wrapper around
<a href="https://github.com/technoweenie/guillotine/">&ldquo;guillotine&rdquo;</a> that made it easy
to run it on Heroku backed by Redis. Back then Heroku still had a free tier and
RedisToGo was available as a free add-on for databases up to 5MB or so. It was
really fun to run, it had <a href="https://github.com/mrtazz/katana/blob/master/app.rb#L28-L39">its own endpoint to support Tweetbot&rsquo;s custom URL
shortening
integration</a> and
the free tier was more than good enough for the occasional shortening.</p>
<p>Over the years however I used it less and less, mostly because Twitter had
started forcing its own URL shortening with auto-expansion when viewing a tweet
on everything. And the experience of using a custom shortener was not on par
with that. I&rsquo;ve also almost lost the database of the shortener a couple of
times because free tiers don&rsquo;t usually come with backups. So I rigged up a
quick GitHub Action that ran once a day,
<a href="https://github.com/jeremyfa/node-redis-dump" title="node-redis-dump"><code>redis-dump</code>-ed</a> all the contents to plain text and committed them to a git
repo as a low budget backup job. At this point I wasn&rsquo;t really shortening
anything anymore but wanted to keep the existing URLs functional. I had moved
to Heroku&rsquo;s own Redis service at that point and there was no real work involved
to keep it running.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2022 Heroku <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter" title="Herokuâ€™s Next Chapter">announced</a> the end of the free tiers. And while I&rsquo;m generally
happy to pay for things I wasn&rsquo;t convinced that just maintaining what was
essentially by now a barely used URL lookup app  was worth the $7/month for me.
So I shut it down and thought about alternatives. I could run the app on my
server that I use for a couple of things. But I really don&rsquo;t want to run a ruby
app + redis in my free time. I thought about implementing the shortener logic
in Go and back it by something like sqlite or even just a yaml file. But again
that felt like a lot of effort for not actually shortening anything.</p>
<p>And then I thought &ldquo;this is just hosting 301 redirects, surely something nginx
is good at&rdquo;. And sure enough, after a quick internet search I found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29354142/nginx-how-to-mass-permanent-redirect-from-a-given-list">a
stackoverflow
post</a>
that provided a good example for managing a lookup map in a handful of lines of
code. The core of it is basically:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># head -n 5 /usr/local/etc/nginx/mrtz_cc_redirect_map.conf

# wc -l /usr/local/etc/nginx/mrtz_cc_redirect_map.conf
424 /usr/local/etc/nginx/mrtz_cc_redirect_map.conf


# cat /usr/local/etc/nginx/sites/redirect
map_hash_bucket_size 256; # see http://nginx.org/en/docs/hash.html

map $request_uri $new_uri {
    include /usr/local/etc/nginx/mrtz_cc_redirect_map.conf;
}

server {
  listen 94.130.5.59:443 ssl;
  server_name mrtz.cc;

  if ($new_uri) {
    return 301 $new_uri;
  }

  ...
}

</code></pre><p>So all I had to do was convert the plain text backup of my redis instance into
the nginx map format, which was easy enough with this <code>awk</code> one-liner:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% head -n 5 backups/mrtz.cc/mrtz.cc.dump
SET     guillotine:hash:-KmaJA 'http://lusis.github.com/blog/2014/04/13/omnibus-redux/'

SET     guillotine:hash:0YK2gg 'https://speakerdeck.com/mrtazz/statsd-workshop-monitorama-2013'

% awk '/guillotine:hash/ { split($2,a,/:/); print &quot;/&quot;a[3]&quot; &quot;$3&quot;;&quot;}' &lt; backups/mrtz.cc/mrtz.cc.dump | head -n 5

</code></pre><p>And then chef out the nginx config and Let&rsquo;s Encrypt setup for the domain to my
server, change the DNS records to the server instead of Heroku<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. And
voila:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% curl -sv https://mrtz.cc/-vvREg 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep Location
&lt; Location: http://hannahmontana.sourceforge.net/
</code></pre><p>I really like this setup because running nginx is pretty straight forward for
the small scale I use it at. And I care about keeping URLs working. So this
makes me happy. I might at some point maybe want to start using it and adding
URLs again. At which point I have to figure something out. But I don&rsquo;t expect
that to be any time soon (if at all).</p>

<p>There were actually some hiccups in the middle where I still had the
DNS configure in dnsimple but had apparently let the domain lapse ðŸ˜…. But
re-registering it with dnsimple was super fast and I just had to wait a bit
then for the registration to propagate.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
