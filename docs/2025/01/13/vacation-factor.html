      <div class="post">
        <h1 class="posttitle"> <a href=""> Vacation Factor </a></h1>

        <p>One of the phrases that are fairly heavily used in tech (as well as many other industries I&rsquo;m sure) is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">&ldquo;bus factor&rdquo;</a>. It basically describes the risk of information, knowledge, and other capabilities not shared amongst team members and therefore would be lost if the only person possessing those things would be &ldquo;hit by a bus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an absolutely awful thought and extremely cruel way to talk and think about other humans. So many years ago (I don&rsquo;t remember when exactly but probably somewhere around 2014) I started to instead use the phrase &ldquo;vacation factor&rdquo; at work. With the definition of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the risk of information, knowledge, or skills being inaccessible when a team member suddenly decides to go on vacation&rdquo;. As a European, vacation to me means it&rsquo;s impossible to contact them because they don&rsquo;t have their laptop with them, don&rsquo;t check slack or email, and otherwise don&rsquo;t answer work calls. As it should be. So the person needs to be assumed completely inaccessible.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about it sounds a lot nicer to me. And it - in addition - normalizes taking frequent vacations as it also should be. It also helps team members think of the fact that coworkers go on vacation and plan for it. Hopefully making the &ldquo;guilt of taking vacation&rdquo; that definitely exists for some people also grow smaller.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the first person to think of this. But I like the phrase and think it should be used more often.</p>
