        <h2> <a href=""> My 2015 Reading List </a></h2>

        <p>This year has been really good for reading for me. Starting off from <a href="https://unwiredcouch.com/2014/12/31/reading-list.html">last year&rsquo;s list</a> and the 5-ish books I read in 2014, I made it to 16
this year. Some of them were very short but nonetheless an improvement. One of my goals for 2015 was to read more and I definitely managed to accomplish
that. My goal for 2016 is to read more than 20 books. If you&rsquo;re interested in
keeping up to date over the year, I usually post my progress and reviews on
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/mrtazz">Goodreads</a> as well.</p>
<p>So without further ado, here&rsquo;s my reading list for 2015:</p>
<h3 id="the-whole-womanwhole_woman-by-germaine-greer"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whole-Woman-Germaine-Greer-ebook/dp/B0026LTNDG">The Whole Woman</a> by Germaine Greer</h3>
<p>As mentioned <a href="https://unwiredcouch.com/2014/12/31/reading-list.html">last year</a> I started reading this book in 2014 and
finished it early 2015. I overall liked it and it was really good in giving me
different ways to think about feminism and how the whole system works together
to enable sexism and exploitation. It&rsquo;s also a good resource to understand
better how closely related feminism and capitalism really are. However it
comes with a really serious trigger warning. Germaine Greer is known to have
very transphobic/cissexist views and this book is no exception. It is
restricted to one chapter but those opinions - which I don&rsquo;t share at all -
are definitely in there. So if this is a trigger for you, it&rsquo;s probably better
to skip this book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pattern of devaluing women&rsquo;s contribution is as old as human
civilization</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="feminism-is-for-everybodyhooks_feminism-by-bell-hooks"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-Passionate-bell-hooks-ebook/dp/B00OCKEF8W">Feminism is for Everybody</a> by Bell Hooks</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known about this book for a while now, but up until early 2015 it was
only available in print. And since I don&rsquo;t really like owning physical books
and read exclusively on my Kindle and iPhone I hadn&rsquo;t bought it yet. So when I
found out there is a Kindle version now, I immediately bought it. As expected,
the book is really good and gives a good primer on feminism and the historical
context from the author&rsquo;s perspective. It reads less extreme to me as Greer
which is very much in line with Hooks&rsquo; other writing. Definitely highly
recommended for learning more about feminism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feminism is a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="designing-for-performancedfp-by-lara-hogan"><a href="http://designingforperformance.com/">Designing for Performance</a> by Lara Hogan</h3>
<p>My coworker <a href="https://twitter.com/lara_hogan">Lara</a> wrote this book last year and it was a lot of fun
watching her process and how she knocked out that book. Since then it was on
my list of books to read. Especially since I tend to shy away from frontend
things in my day job and want to get better at not doing that. The book is a
wonderful introduction into web performance especially from a design view. It
gives very solid technical details on a lot of things like browser rendering
and image formats that I only had very superficial knowledge of before. I
really enjoyed it and the book lead me to <a href="https://unwiredcouch.com/2015/07/24/frontend-performance.html">reduce the page weight of this blog
by 92%</a> which was tons of fun to do as well.</p>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="manage-your-day-to-dayday_to_day-by-jocelyn-glei"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manage-Your-Day---Day-Creative-ebook/dp/B00B77UE4W">Manage your Day-to-Day</a> by Jocelyn Glei</h3>
<p>This book sparked my interest while I was looking for improving my daily
routines. I was often just starting the day as it happened often leaving me
feel disorganized, unproductive, and imbalanced. Reading &ldquo;Manage your
Day-to-Day&rdquo; gave me a lot of ideas of what things to try and add to my daily
routine. And also to try and even have a daily routine. Something I picked up
again through this book was journaling and while it has been on and off for
the last couple of months I really enjoy it. The book was not mind blowing for
me but I enjoyed reading it and definitely would recommend it if you are
looking for inspiration for your daily routine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It takes willpower to switch off the world, even for an hour.</p>

<h3 id="leading-snowflakessnowflakes-by-oren-ellenbogen"><a href="http://leadingsnowflakes.com/">Leading Snowflakes</a> by Oren Ellenbogen</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about this book ever since it was released and a lot of people I
know speak very highly of it. And they weren&rsquo;t wrong, I basically devoured the
book in a weekend. It&rsquo;s very well written and has a ton of actionable advice
for engineers becoming managers. But I would argue that this description
really limits the value of the book. I have no intention to become a manager
at the moment however the book was really interesting and helpful for me. I
think it&rsquo;s a great read for anyone looking to grow more into a leadership
position.</p>
<h3 id="the-highly-sensitive-personhighly_sensitive-by-elaine-n-aron"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Highly-Sensitive-Person-Elaine-Aron-ebook/dp/B00GT1YES8">The Highly Sensitive Person</a> by Elaine N. Aron</h3>
<p>I had no idea about the concept of highly sensitive people until I read <a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4810794">this
article</a>. It has a pretty click-baity headline but it
really hit home for me. So I decided to learn more about it and this book was
the most prominent resource to pop up in my search. It&rsquo;s a really good book
with a lot of great psychological insights and explicit case studies. At times
the way high sensitivity was described was a bit too feel-good for my taste.
At other times I would almost throw my kindle across the room as the author
managed to really sneak up on and hijack my sensitivity. The book focuses a
lot on what usually goes wrong during childhood for highly sensitive people
and makes it a point to relive memories and traumas through the lense of high
sensitivity. This is a practice I really enjoyed although it felt a bit much
to me at times as I consider my childhood to have been a happy one. On the
other hand I started to do this practice with every day situations at work to
help me understand why I feel what I feel in different situations.  I identify
myself as a highly sensitive person and the book was an extremely good read to
help me understand better what this could mean for me and my days.</p>
<h3 id="recoding-genderrecoding_gender-by-janet-abbate"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Recoding-Gender-Changing-Participation-Computing-ebook/dp/B009Z3U46S">Recoding Gender</a> by Janet Abbate</h3>
<p>I have a very complex relationship with the profession of &ldquo;software
engineering&rdquo; and how it&rsquo;s often defined in a non-inclusive way and as the
profession of the golden children of society. Part of that is that I had
always known a bit about the origins of programming and that a majority of
programmers used to be women. But I didn&rsquo;t know a lot about it which is why I
was excited to read this book. And it was great! The book walks you through
the beginnings before and during WWII and what programming meant back then. It
discusses how the emerging industry in this field changed job prospects and
economic chances for women. But it also discusses how the image of a
programmer changed as more and more men participated. It&rsquo;s full of historical
facts and documents and a more than wonderful read. It sparked a lot of
thoughts for me and changed the way I think about my profession even more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the traits that managers found most problematic in programmers were those
stereotypically associated with men</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="you-had-me-at-hello-worldhello_world-by-dona-sarkar"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/You-Had-Hello-World-Mentoring-ebook/dp/B0147SC2WO">You had me at &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo;</a> by Dona Sarkar</h3>
<p>I found this book through <a href="https://twitter.com/skamille">Camille</a> tweeting about the fact that she
was also interviewed for it. &ldquo;You had me at &lsquo;Hellow  World&rsquo;&rdquo; is a collection
of interviews with industry leaders from successful companies about the many
aspects of leadership and mentoring. It&rsquo;s a pretty lightweight read and a
great resource to get some insight how successful people talk about those
topics. It does a great job in conveying how important skills outside of
writing code are. And it provides good examples of how to use those for your
advantage.</p>
<h3 id="nonviolent-communicationnonviolent_comm-by-marshall-b-rosenberg"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-Relationships-ebook/dp/B014OISVU4">Nonviolent Communication</a> by Marshall B. Rosenberg</h3>
<p>This has been recommended by many people I work with as a wonderful resource
about positive human communication. And as - especially in a growing
engineering org - communication is one of the most important skills to try to
master, I decided to finally read this one. It&rsquo;s a very interesting book with
an approach to communication that is rarely taught especially not to men. It
focuses on a collaborative rather than a competitive style of communication
and the goal to reach agreements over winning arguments. The examples in the
book are often pretty extreme coming from the author&rsquo;s work as a diplomat. And
even though those are great to demonstrate how this way of communicating can
work in the most extreme cases, it also shifts its focus a lot on explicit
diplomatic style discussions. There are more examples that are more directed
towards every day situations and even though the author is very explicit about
this being useful in regular work meetings as well, I had a very hard time
understanding how to practically apply those lessons in a meeting for example.
That being said however it made me think a lot more about the way I
communicate and what I&rsquo;m saying versus what I want to say. I have also applied
that way of communicating successfully at least once since reading the book.
And I look forward to try it out more.</p>
<h3 id="the-retrospective-handbookretrospective-by-patrick-kua"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Retrospective-Handbook-guide-agile-teams-ebook/dp/B00916BRVU">The Retrospective Handbook</a> by Patrick Kua</h3>
<p>At work we have a group of people which I&rsquo;m part of that work on making sure
we have good frameworks in place for blameless postmortems and organizational
learning as a whole. Part of that is moving past only investigating failure
(via postmortems) and also look into investigating successes (via
retrospectives). So in a similar way to how I&rsquo;ve spent time understanding the
unhelpful concept of human error, I wanted to learn more about the theoretical
concepts of successful retrospectives. Unfortunately this was completely the
wrong book for this. It is a great and very practical read for retrospectives
in the agile sense and how to run successful meetings in general. However I
wasn&rsquo;t looking for that so I constantly kept thinking when we are going to
dive into the meaty, theoretical stuff. This is in no way the authors fault
and I would highly recommend the book as inspiration for improving your
meetings. But for the theoretical underpinnings of retrospectives as an
organizational learning tool I&rsquo;m still on the lookout. Let me know if you have
recommendations :).</p>
<h3 id="cybersexism-sex-gender-and-power-on-the-internetcybersexism-by-laurie-penny"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cybersexism-Sex-Gender-Power-Internet-ebook/dp/B00EO24J3O">Cybersexism: Sex, Gender and Power on the Internet</a> by Laurie Penny</h3>
<p>This short book by Laurie Penny is a very good read about sexism in the age of
social networks and the omnipresent Internet. It does a great job at talking
about how a lot of familiar concepts of &ldquo;offline sexism&rdquo; are reinvented online
and no news to women. It&rsquo;s short and insightful enough to recommend reading it
without hesitation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps one reason that women writers and technologists have, so far, the calmest and most comprehensive understanding of what surveillance technology really does to the human condition is that women grow up being watched.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-boy-kingsboy_kings-by-katherine-losse"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boy-Kings-Journey-Social-Network-ebook/dp/B007MAXH38">The Boy Kings</a> by Katherine Losse</h3>
<p>The biography of Kate Losse about her time at (earl stage) Facebook is in my
mind a must read for any software engineer and especially if you&rsquo;re a man. It
gives an extremely good insight view into what happens when young men are
suddenly in charge of a ton of money. But more importantly it talks very
bluntly about how engineers are treated differently from most other employees
for our supposed gift to turn any idea into gold with code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technology carries with it all the biases of the people who make it, so simply making the world more technical was not going to save us.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-art-of-mindfulnessmindfulness-by-thích-nhất-hạnh"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Mindfulness-HarperOne-Select-Selects-ebook/dp/B005HG4H24">The Art of Mindfulness</a> by Thích Nhất Hạnh</h3>
<p>This is another super short read and the de-facto introductory book to
mindfulness meditation. There&rsquo;s not a lot to say here. It&rsquo;s good, give it a
read as it&rsquo;s short enough to not matter if you end up not liking it. I started
meditating regularly after reading it and it has been a great experience.</p>
<h3 id="men-explain-things-to-memen_explain-by-rebecca-solnit"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Men-Explain-Things-Rebecca-Solnit-ebook/dp/B00IWGQ8PU">Men Explain Things to Me</a> by Rebecca Solnit</h3>
<p>This collection of essays titled for the aggressive tendency of men to always
have to explain things to women while assuming they have no idea what they are
talking about. The first essay brings this to a point by telling a story of a
party where a man mansplains to the author the book she herself wrote. Without
having actually read it. The book than continues with more essays that talk
about a lot more darker things like discussing domestic violence. The over
arching theme is that the credibility of and respect towards women is
continuously diminished to maintain the status quo and its power imbalance.
Some of the essays towards the end of the book are not easy to read but it&rsquo;s
more than worth it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Credibility is a basic survival tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dont-make-me-thinkdont_make_think-by-steve-krug"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability-ebook/dp/B00HJUBRPG">Don&rsquo;t Make Me Think</a> by Steve Krug</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those engineers who used to happily claim to not have any frontend
skills and just not be good at design. I came to loathe this thinking over
the years and decided that if I can&rsquo;t do something I want to learn at least
the basics. This is one of the reasons why I read &ldquo;Designing for Performance&rdquo;
as mentioned above. Thankfully I also work with a ton of talented designers
and one of them is <a href="https://twitter.com/harllee">Jessica Harllee</a>. I talked to her about
suggestions to get started with learning about design. And she said I should
read &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me think&rdquo;. And she wasn&rsquo;t wrong. The book is a wonderful
introduction into usability and design. The beauty of it is that while reading
it, all of the things mentioned are total no-brainers. But you have to
remember it while designing things. The other interesting thing for me was
that while all of the examples in the book are web based (with some brief
stints into mobile) I could totally think of CLI apps I&rsquo;ve written in the past
that totally do the wrong thing design-wise. Definitely a recommended read.</p>
<h3 id="the-internet-of-garbageinternet_garbage-by-sarah-jeong"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Internet-Garbage-Sarah-Jeong-ebook/dp/B011JAV030">The Internet of Garbage</a> by Sarah Jeong</h3>
<p>In this book Sarah Jeong - a journalist trained as a lawyer at Harvard Law
School - talks about the problem of online harassment. It&rsquo;s another short but
really good one. I&rsquo;ve learned a ton about copyright law and the limitations of
current legislation when it comes to online harassment. But also things that
do work and what things could be attempted. It&rsquo;s a very sobering look at the
current state of social networks, online harassment and tooling and
legislation to help fight it. Definitely worth a read if you spend any time on
the internet.</p>
