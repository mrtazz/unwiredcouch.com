        <h2> <a href=""> My Rules for E-Mail Happiness </a></h2>

        <p>Over the last couple of days and maybe weeks a lot of my friends, coworkers
and most of all people I follow on twitter have been overly excited about the
beta availability of <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com">an e-mail client</a>. At first I was being
regrettably <a href="https://twitter.com/mrtazz/status/501909189577687040">very snarky about it</a> as in my opinion the mail
client in question has some serious privacy and availability issues. But as
more and more people got excited about it I took a step back and thought about
why I couldn&rsquo;t understand the excitement and why people would give up their
privacy for &ldquo;better e-mail&rdquo;. And it dawned on me that I have never actually
seen e-mail as that problematic and annoying and that I actually like my
setup a lot. This is why I decided to share how I do e-mail and why it works
well for me (yes you may consider this one of those productivity blog posts).</p>
<h3 id="setting-the-stage">Setting the stage</h3>
<p>Before I start I want to make very clear that I&rsquo;m likely not a power email
user and what works for me might not work for you. This is also mostly about
how I manage my work email, as my personal email is low volume enough so that
it&rsquo;s probably not interesting. I also use a <a href="http://www.mutt.org">somewhat esoteric e-mail
client</a> and while most of the things I&rsquo;ll talk about are generic, using
mutt makes it a lot easier for me. And to give you a ballpark number for
e-mail volume: I receive about 370 e-mails per day - your mileage may
vary.</p>
<h3 id="so-how-do-i-use-e-mail">So how <em>do</em> I use e-mail?</h3>
<p>The first two very important factors for me are filtering and <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero">Inbox
Zero</a>.  I am subscribed to a ton of mailing lists at work.
Everything I deem interesting (and I&rsquo;m a super nosy person) I subscribe to,
but I have strict rules about what goes into my inbox:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-mails addressed directly to me</li>
<li>My team&rsquo;s mailing list</li>
<li>Mailing lists of teams I work closely with</li>
<li>Low volume mailing lists (less than 5 messages a day)</li>
<li>Important automated e-mails (e.g. from Nagios)</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else gets filtered into separate mailboxes. No exceptions. If a low
volume list gets more busy it gets filtered.</p>
<p>With this setup I check my inbox a couple of times a day. The frequency
depends on how busy I am obviously, but I check e-mail at most every 30
minutes and at least 5 times a day. And everything that is filtered I check
once a day up until once a week, depending on how important the mailing list
is. I also clear out all mailboxes at least once a week and archive all e-mail
in there. This usually takes about 5 - 20 minutes and I do it before doing my
weekly GTD review.</p>
<p>In mutt I also use the <a href="https://github.com/mrtazz/muttfiles/blob/master/mutt-colors-solarized-light-16.muttrc">solarized light theme</a> (as I do almost
everywhere else) which helps a lot as e-mails are color coded differently.
Read e-mails are gray, e-mails addressed to me directly or via cc are green
and messages from mailing lists are blue. That way I can open up mutt, take a
quick glance to see if I have new important email or if I can postpone going
through my email. This is sometimes so fast that my terminal emulator warns me
about the <a href="https://twitter.com/mrtazz/statuses/467405164790693888">shell being closed too fast again</a> and there might be
something wrong, which I still find hilarious. When I actually go through my
e-mail, I file them into mailboxes depending on whether I want to read them
later or already know that they need an answer and archive everything else.
Following the GTD principle if I can answer the e-mail in 2 minutes I do it
right away.  Otherwise I move it to the corresponding mailbox from which it
gets <a href="http://www.unwiredcouch.com/2014/05/13/omnifocus.html">pulled into my Omnifocus inbox</a>. All of this is done
with simple keyboard shortcuts that work on single or multiple messages.</p>
<p>I also have e-mail set up on my iPhone with the iOS built-in mail client via
IMAP. However I only ever skim e-mail on there and at most answer if it takes
me less than 2 minutes. I also have the labeling enabled that tells me whether
a messages was sent to me directly or via cc or just because I&rsquo;m part of a
mailing list. That way I can also check very quickly if there is something in
there that potentially needs my attention.</p>
<h3 id="the-important-part">The important part</h3>
<p>The most important part to take away from this is that <strong>you don&rsquo;t need to
read all e-mail you get</strong>. Especially in a big company there are enough things
going on that you can&rsquo;t possibly keep up with everything. And that&rsquo;s ok. In
addition to that what really works for me is using trusted clients that have
been around for a while. I have been using mutt for years and I have most of
its shortcuts in my muscle memory. When I came to work after a week of
vacation and had <a href="https://twitter.com/mrtazz/statuses/486165858809815040">6000 emails in my inbox</a> it took me 10 seconds
to clear out all the automated emails based on their from addresses and cut
the number of messages by 95%. The learning curve for mutt was pretty steep at
the beginning but it has payed off over the years and since it&rsquo;s open source I
know it will be around and not suddenly disappear (or at least it&rsquo;s unlikely).
I also love being able to write my e-mail in vim and am a big fan of plain
text e-mails. On my phone I also use the built-in e-mail client as it&rsquo;s likely
to stay and not completely disappear or get shut down either. My usage on the
phone is also light enough so I don&rsquo;t care about small changes in UX or
functionality with OS upgrades. I have yet to encounter a bad surprise after
upgrading my phone.</p>
<p>When it comes to dealing with stress and the feeling of being overwhelmed with
e-mail, the biggest change for me besides filtering was to turn off all
notifications. No e-mail that I receive will ever make a sound or make my
phone vibrate. There are no lock screen notifications on my phone besides
e-mail from people in my iPhone VIP list which is mostly family and even then
it just shows up. No sound, no vibration. I decide when I have time to read
e-mail.</p>
<p>As I said, most of these things are applicable no matter what e-mail client
you use. I happen to use mutt (set up similar to how it&rsquo;s explained
<a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/the-homely-mutt/">here</a> and these are my <a href="https://github.com/mrtazz/muttfiles">config files</a> in case you&rsquo;re
interested), but there are a ton of good and proven clients out there (I used
OSX Mail.app for years and always liked it). And plain old IMAP is honestly
pretty cool. But most of all - in my opinion - the biggest problems with
e-mail are social or rather psychological problems (trying to keep up with
everything, wanting to get notified all the time) and not technological ones,
and they can be solved.</p>
