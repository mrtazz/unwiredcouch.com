        <h2> <a href=""> 2014 Reading List </a></h2>

        <p>This year I tried again to keep up the flow of reading books. I&rsquo;m an awfully
slow reader when it comes to books in general (not so much for blog posts
interestingly) but I managed to read a handful of books and I wanted to share
my thoughts about it. Mostly because I got inspired by reading <a href="http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/12/30/reading-list-2014.html">Mathias&rsquo;
reading list</a> but also because I wanted to have a track record of
what I read and hopefully inspire myself to read even more next year.</p>
<p>So without further ado, here is my list:</p>
<h3 id="germaine-greer---the-female-eunuchfemale_eunuch"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Female-Eunuch-Germaine-Greer/dp/006157953X">Germaine Greer - The Female Eunuch</a></h3>
<p>I started the year off with finally finishing Germaine Greer&rsquo;s feminist
classic from 1970 about the role of women in modern society. I had known about
the book for a couple of years and after having read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Change-Men-Masculinity-Love/dp/0743456084">Bell Hooks&rsquo; The Will to
Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love</a> last year I decided to finally read
it. I definitely enjoyed it. Especially as a man it opens your eyes to a lot
of things you never encounter in your daily life. It&rsquo;s very graphic at times
and there are some long-winded parts in the middle but I would definitely
recommend it to anyone who&rsquo;s interested in feminism. I also started reading
her newest book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whole-Woman-Germaine-Greer/dp/0385720033">&ldquo;The Whole Woman&rdquo;</a> this year which is the sequel
she never wanted to write. And so far I like it and it&rsquo;s alarming how few
things have changed since &ldquo;The Female Eunuch&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="erik-hollnagel---the-etto-principle-efficiency-thoroughness-trade-offetto"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/ETTO-Principle-Efficiency-Thoroughness-Trade-Off/dp/0754676781/">Erik Hollnagel - The ETTO Principle: Efficiency-Thoroughness Trade-Off</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that I&rsquo;m interested in <a href="http://www.unwiredcouch.com/2014/08/04/human-error-getting-off-the-hook.html">human factors and system
safety</a> and how to apply lessons learned to our field of creating
and managing complex computer systems. So it also shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise that
this book really hit home for me. It&rsquo;s well written and touches on a myriad of
different aspects about how we trade off thoroughness for efficiency and how
production pressure changes our way of making decisions. It&rsquo;s a pretty fast
read and I really enjoyed it. It also has a huge references and related
literature section following each chapter which makes it great to start diving
deeper into the topic.</p>
<h3 id="the-phoenix-project-a-novel-about-it-devops-and-helping-your-business-winphoenix"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509">The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win</a></h3>
<p>I originally started reading it in 2013 when it came out and I enjoyed it back
then. But I somehow still dropped the ball and stopped reading it. I finally
went back and finished it this summer. It&rsquo;s a good and interesting read and
having worked in traditional plant production companies I liked a lot of the
parallels in there. It gets a little weird at the end and the last quarter
feels like the authors really had to wrap up the book. And no matter how you
look at it, it&rsquo;s definitely business romanticism. But if you don&rsquo;t mind that,
it&rsquo;s definitely entertaining.</p>
<h3 id="susan-cain---quiet-the-power-of-introverts-in-a-world-that-cant-stop-talkingquiet"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153">Susan Cain - Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&rsquo;t Stop Talking</a></h3>
<p>This is another one I started in 2013 and then dropped for no real reason. I
finished it this year and thoroughly enjoyed it. I knew before I started
reading that I fall on the introvert side of the scale but the book really
helped recognizing some more patterns and making me feel better about it. This
is also the only book I finished as a Kindle audiobook and while I likely
won&rsquo;t do it again, it was an interesting experience. It&rsquo;s a great read and
definitely recommended for anyone who works with other humans in their daily
life.</p>
<h3 id="kourosh-dini---create-flow-with-omnifocus-2of_flow"><a href="http://www.usingomnifocus.com">Kourosh Dini - Create Flow with OmniFocus 2</a></h3>
<p>This one was kind of a surprise read for me. I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.unwiredcouch.com/2014/05/13/omnifocus.html">written before</a>
about how much I have OmniFocus is integrated in my life. And when this book
popped up <a href="http://simplicitybliss.com">in one of my RSS feeds</a> I decided to give it a
read. It&rsquo;s definitely not a cheap book and I jumped over the first half as
it&rsquo;s basically an introduction into OmniFocus which I already know how to use.
The book isn&rsquo;t a total game changer, but the latter half gives some good food
for thought on how to make the most of OmniFocus&rsquo; Perspectives and some
unusual use cases for it.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-jon-cowie---customizing-chefchef"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Customizing-Chef-Jon-Cowie/dp/149194935X">Bonus: Jon Cowie - Customizing Chef</a></h3>
<p>I added this as a bonus round, because while I definitely read it, I had the
privilege to do so as a reviewer. I&rsquo;m really happy that <a href="https://twitter.com/jonlives">Jon</a> asked me
to review his book and while I had done a lot of Chef before, I learned tons
about its internals from this book. If you work with Chef and want to get more
out of it or even just understand some of the internals a little better,
definitely read this book.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed reading all those books this year. And one of my New Year&rsquo;s
resolutions is definitely to read more next year. I&rsquo;ve planned to set some
time aside every day to read and hope to have a longer list of things I read
next year. If not, it sure isn&rsquo;t because of a small Kindle backlog.</p>
