  <p>It’s really short, more of an essay really, so there’s no reason not to read it. It gives a couple of really good and fairly practical tips about what to find out about oneself in order to be effective and successful.</p>
<p>One of the things that definitely did strike me as interesting were Drucker’s points about taking notes and writing things down in general:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I don’t write it down immediately, I forget it right away. If I put it into a sketch book, I never forget it and I never have to look it up again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve had this experience so frequently, especially as a kid in school. That when I wrote something down (e.g. homework for the day) I rarely needed to look it up again but remembered what I had to do. Because I would also often remember it either way, I sadly drew the wrong conclusion there (namely that writing things down isn’t worth the hassle). Which stifled my note taking skills and a lot of my learning later on. It wasn’t until a couple of years ago that I realized that it was precisely that process of writing things down that made me memorize my homework.</p>
<p>A good part of the book also is about figuring out which version of yourself you want to be. Which I think is a really important aspect of maturing as a person and figuring out why you’re even trying to get better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is the mirror test. Ethics requires that you ask yourself, what kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning?</p>
</blockquote>
