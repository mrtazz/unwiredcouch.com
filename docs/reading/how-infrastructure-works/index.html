  <p>I preordered this book immediately when I saw it flying by in my Mastodon stream. I&rsquo;ve long been interested in infrastructure and especially having worked in tech infrastructure for a long time I love thinking about how to provide good services and utilities. The book was actually a lot different from what I expected. I somehow thought there was more in depth discussions of the inner workings of different types of infrastructure. But what I got instead was way better. The book is a fantastic ode to infrastructure and does a great job conveying the kind of fascination I&rsquo;ve had with it for a long time. But it also goes even further. It talks a lot about the kind of contexts in which infrastructure was and is built. And how it furthers general assumptions about who benefits in what ways from it. And there is also a lot of focus on climate change, both how infrastructure is a contributing factor in it and how it can be part of a more sustainable future.</p>
<p>All in all I throughly enjoyed this book and can highly recommend it.</p>
