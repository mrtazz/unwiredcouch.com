  <p>This book caught my eye while I was browsing for art books. I‚Äôve been trying
for a while to incorporate (almost) daily drawing back into my daily schedule.
But in a lighter weight way with less pressure to do finished pieces. And ‚ÄúDraw
People Every Day‚Äù definitely fit the bill for that. The book provides a great
high level overview for getting started with ink drawing and dives deeper into
various topics like e.g. the importance of drawing from life, gesture drawing
and how to achieve different effects with line weights. The same approach is
then taken in the final chapter to talk about using color for quick sketching.</p>
<p>After having spent a lot of time on learning how to draw in the last 2 years,
there weren‚Äôt a lot of things that were really new to me in this book. However
it‚Äôs the book I wish I had 2 years ago when I got started. It does a great job
laying down the fundamentals for getting started with sketching. And it
definitely inspired me to do more quick sketching and drawing from life.</p>
