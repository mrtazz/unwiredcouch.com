<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>This paper outlines how past successes drive the creation of bigger and ever
more complex systems. And the risk of not being able to adapt fast enough to
changing environments and systems. The gap between the adaptation possible and
the adaptation required by an organisation is called “The Strategic Agility
Gap” and a fundamental requirement to be able to bridge that gap is the
ability to react to unplanned failure called “SNAFU catching”.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-discussion">Detailed discussion</h2>
<p>The paper approaches the topic of how organisations deal with the challenge of
keeping up with an ever accelerating pace of change in environments and
systems that get more and more complex. While the focus here is mostly threats
and challenges in the term of surprising failures. It’s also mentioned that
slow adaptability also has implications for the ability to seize
opportunities. Organisations of course aren’t generally not adapting at all.
They are always navigating within their range of agility to adapt to new
situations. However the problem arises when this “strategic agility” as it is
called in the paper isn’t enough to account for the surrounding changes (e.g.
systems and environment) and provide adaptability for new challenges. The
difference between the existing level of agility and the required agility to
match the surrounding pace of change is what is called “the Strategic Agility
Gap”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is a mismatch in velocities of change and velocities of adaptation (Fig. 1)” (Woods, 2020, p. 96)</p></blockquote>
<p>This is also outlined nicely in this diagram in the paper:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/reading/woods-strategicagilitygap-2020-diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In order to illustrate this gap the paper discusses two cases: The 2012 Knight
Capital Collapse during which an organisation wasn’t prepared to adapt to
their changed environment and an incident related to “runaway” automation. And
the case of large transport firms coping with the impacts and fallout of
Hurricane Sandy in the same year.</p>
<p>In the case of the Knight Capital collapse a list of 5 risks are outlined that
contributed to the organization’s inability to deal with the incident:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“First, small problems can interact and cascade quickly and surprisingly
given the tangle of dependencies across layers inside and outside the
organization. Second, as effects cascade and uncertainties grow, multiple
roles struggle to understand anomalies, diagnose underlying drivers,
identify compensatory actions. Third, difficulties arise getting
authorization from appropriate roles to make non-routine, risky, and
resource costly actions, while uncertainty remains. Fourth, all of the above
take effort, time, and require coordination across roles. […] Fifth, when
critical replanning decisions require serial communication vertically
through the levels of the organization, responses are unable to keep pace
with events.” (Woods, 2020, p. 98)</p></blockquote>
<p>And in contrast the transportation firms were “poised to adapt” in the
scenario they were dealing with due to constant preparatory work that preceded
the incident that put them in a position to be able to quickly react:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Upper management developed mechanisms for this shift prior to particular
challenge events. As hurricane Sandy approached New York, temporary teams
were created quickly to provide timely updates (weather impact analysis
teams).” (Woods, 2020, p. 98)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“These mechanisms existed because this firm’s business model, environment,
clientele, and external events regularly required adaptation as surprises
were a normal experience.” (Woods, 2020, p. 98)</p></blockquote>
<p>And in contrasting the cases, the paper again emphasises the importance of
being able to adapt not only within a layer of work but also vertically
throughout an organisation to push decision making and coordination onto
layers that allow for timely reaction to the current situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the strategic agility gap, the challenge for organizations is to develop
new forms of coordination across functional, spatial, and temporal
scales—otherwise organizations will be slow, stale and fragmented as they
inevitably confront surprising challenges.” (Woods, 2020, p. 99)</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper then zooms out to a more high level view on systems and their
messiness. Highlighting the fact that all development and operations of
systems are limited by the fact that resources are finite. And thus
preparatory vehicles like plans and automation can never cover the full extent
of complexity of a given system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All systems are developed and operate given finite resources and live in a
changing environment [5]. As a result, plans, procedures, automation, all
agents and roles are inherently limited and unable to completely cover the
complexity of activities, events, demands, and change” (Woods, 2020, p. 99)</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a point that is also expanded upon in Woods’ 2023 paper <a href="https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/paper-command-adapt-paradox/">“Resolving
the Command–Adapt Paradox: Guided Adaptability to Cope with
Complexity“</a>)
in greater detail to highlight the limitations of plans and automation.</p>
<p>As an essential capability in dealing with this predicament of having to
quickly react to an always changing world that is only predictable in very
narrow terms, Woods notes what him and Cook termed “SNFU” catching: The
ability of people to adapt outside of standard plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“SNAFU catching, however technologically facilitated, is a fundamentally
human capability essential for organizational viability […] people in some
roles provide the essential adaptive capacity for SNAFU catching, though
this may be local, underground, and invisible to distant perspectives [12].”
(Woods, 2020, p. 99)</p></blockquote>
<p>And with SNAFU being the normal operation, even though as the paper argues it
is often rationalised away as a fringe phenomenon to put pressure on
work-to-{plan,role,rule} and with that hindering the effectiveness and
visibility of SNAFU catching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The compliance pressure undermines the adaptive capacities needed for SNAFU
catching (initiative), creates double binds that drive adaptations to make
the system work ‘underground,’ and generates role retreat that undermines
coordinated activities.” (Woods, 2020, p. 100)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the conclusion the paper then outlines a path out of the Strategic Agility
Gap which is continuous adaptation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For organizations to flourish in the gap they need to build and sustain the
ability to continuously adapt.” (Woods, 2020, p. 101)</p></blockquote>
<p>It draws on lessons from Web Operations where outages and near outages are
common in a world where systems are constantly changing and due to past
success are enabled to grow and change continuously. It is also a field that
has and is becoming more and more important as almost every system is becoming
a digital system at least in parts. And in this complex world the limitations
of planning are becoming more and more apparent with the underlying layer of
resilience to not have them fail catastrophically all the time is SNAFU
catching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Organizational systems succeed despite the basic limits of plans in a
complex, interdependent and changing environment because responsible people
adapt to make the system work despite its design—SNAFU catching. The
ingredients are:” (Woods, 2020, p. 102)</p></blockquote>
<p>With the mentioned ingredients being:</p>
<ul>
<li>anticipation</li>
<li>contingent synchronisation</li>
<li>readiness to respond</li>
<li>proactive learning</li>
</ul>
<p>With these behaviours and properties often being severely reduced by the
pressure to work-to-{plan/rule/role}, compliance, and worst the fear of
sanctions when any of these expectations are violated.  And in summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Strategic agility gap arises as organizations’ trajectory of improvement
cannot match the emergence of new challenges, risks, and opportunities as
complexity penalties grow (Fig. 1). To flourish in the gap requires
organizations to build and sustain capabilities for SNAFU catching.” (Woods,
2020, p. 103)</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="personal-thoughts">Personal Thoughts</h2>
<p>This paper was fascinating to me in a couple of ways. But having the visual of
“a gap” in the capacity and capabilities of an organisation was to me an
extremely useful way of framing the problem. The paper also casually gave me
the best and most succinct definition of DevOps I have ever seen in a decade
or so of blog posts and talks trying to define it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Reciprocity in collaborative work is commitment to mutual assistance.”
(Woods, 2020, p. 103)</p></blockquote>
