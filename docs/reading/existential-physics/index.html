  <p>I saw this book in my regular bookstore and the topic really interested me. So
I started reading the book with no preconception or notion of who the author
was. Only halfway through or so I found out she also has a somewhat popular
YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Reading the book was a bit of a split for me. The author definitely does a good
job (as far as I can tell) explaining physics concepts and theories in a way
that is understandable and with the given topic in mind. And the fact that the
book is structured as chapters where each answers a specific question also
makes it a really quick and interesting read. However there have also been
parts of the book where the tone bordered on obnoxious for me with the cliche
undertone (or sometimes even explicit statement) that eventually everything can
‚Äújust‚Äù be explained with physics and how - in the author‚Äôs view - many people
(even other scientists) are incorrect in their assumptions and world views.
Which I find more jarring than entertaining. But the core idea in the book that
there are some views (e.g. the existence of a god) that are neither scientific
nor un-scientific as they can‚Äôt be proven or disproven. But rather a-scientific
as they are compatible with current science since nothing we currently know
confirms or refutes them. I‚Äôve found this to be a really good frame for
thinking about the world. Overall I enjoyed the book with some caveats.</p>
