  <p>This has been recommended by many people I work with as a wonderful resource
about positive human communication. And as - especially in a growing
engineering org - communication is one of the most important skills to try to
master, I decided to finally read this one. It&rsquo;s a very interesting book with
an approach to communication that is rarely taught especially not to men. It
focuses on a collaborative rather than a competitive style of communication
and the goal to reach agreements over winning arguments. The examples in the
book are often pretty extreme coming from the author&rsquo;s work as a diplomat. And
even though those are great to demonstrate how this way of communicating can
work in the most extreme cases, it also shifts its focus a lot on explicit
diplomatic style discussions. There are more examples that are more directed
towards every day situations and even though the author is very explicit about
this being useful in regular work meetings as well, I had a very hard time
understanding how to practically apply those lessons in a meeting for example.
That being said however it made me think a lot more about the way I
communicate and what I&rsquo;m saying versus what I want to say. I have also applied
that way of communicating successfully at least once since reading the book.
And I look forward to try it out more.</p>
