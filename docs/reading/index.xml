      <title>Safety-I and Safety–II</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of following Hollnagel&amp;rsquo;s work and having read &lt;a href=&#34;../reading/hollnagel-ettoprinciple-2009/&#34;&gt;ETTO&lt;/a&gt; many years
ago, I finally read this (now) classic that he wrote in 2014. And I have to
say it still holds up extremely well even 10 years later. It&amp;rsquo;s a mostly easy
read that introduces and explains concepts from the approach that is branded
in the book as &amp;ldquo;Safety I&amp;rdquo;, which is the focus on preventing accidents versus
what he calls &amp;ldquo;Safety II&amp;rdquo;, the focus on fostering and increasing things that
go right. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot in this book about the history of safety and risk
management and how we got to this focus on accidents as the data point to
fixate on. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly quick read and I can highly recommend it if you do
anything related to safety, risk, or resilience management or even just work
in an area where you are responsible for operating any form of live system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reimagining Capitalism in a World on Fire</title>
      <link>https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/rebeccahenderson-reimaginingcapitalisminaworldonfire-2021/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my journey this year to read a bit more about economic topics, I came
across this book in my bookstore and was curious about. There&amp;rsquo;s lots of
discussion currently about how bad capitalism is but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a ton
about what could be better. So I was curious to read more about that part. The
book overall did an ok job there. A lot of cases are outlined where people went
against &amp;ldquo;common sense&amp;rdquo; of capitalism and increasing shareholder value and
built or grew companies that were and are very successful. There are a lot of
examples there that the author outlines as strong reasons to be hopeful.
However reading this in 2025 where things feel like they&amp;rsquo;ve only gotten worse
in the years since the book got published a lot of it rings kinda hollow. And
the examples feel more like anecdotes than signs for a better way. It&amp;rsquo;s a very
well written and researched book. And I think if I had read it in 2021 I
would&amp;rsquo;ve taken away a lot more positive things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Die Schuldenbremse</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the same spirit that made me read &lt;a href=&#34;../reading/charleswheelan-nakedeconomicsundressingthedismalscience-2019/&#34;&gt;Naked Economics&lt;/a&gt; I had also asked a
friend who&amp;rsquo;s an economist whether he knew any good books to learn the basics
about economics but also specifically about the &amp;ldquo;Schuldenbremse&amp;rdquo;, Germany&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_balanced_budget_amendment&#34;&gt;balanced budget amendment&lt;/a&gt; flippantly called &amp;ldquo;debt brake&amp;rdquo;. So he
recommended me Bajohr&amp;rsquo;s essay on the topic which ended up a very brief but
interesting read. The author collects a good amount of history on the topic
and how it came to be and then goes on to outline his critique of it and how
it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help in many cases and in others even makes things worse. It is
written in a very accessible way even for someone like me who&amp;rsquo;s not super well
versed in economics terms and theories. I can highly recommend it if you want
to learn about this topic that was a huge contributing factor in the failing
of the last German government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I knew the author from when he was moderating tons of shows on VIVA, the
German version of MTV. And I kinda knew that he had mostly given up working in
media to work as a paramedic instead. So when I saw that he wrote a book about
hiking with his mother I was kinda curious about it. I think the start is a
bit bumpy and it feels more like a boring day by day telling of someone not
enjoying their hike. But even though the trip gets harder and harder
throughout the book, the narration gets a lot more interesting and personal.
And the musings about hiking, tourism, but also mortality spoke to me a lot
and I really enjoyed the book overall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Morrigan</title>
      <link>https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/kimcurran-themorrigan-2025/</link>

      <guid>https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/kimcurran-themorrigan-2025/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&#34;../reading/katherinearden-thebearandthenightingale-2017/&#34;&gt;The Bear and the
Nightingale&lt;/a&gt; and
having already ordered the followups I wanted some more mystical fiction books
to read. So when I stumbled upon this book at my bookstore I was immediately
interested. Especially since my knowledge of Irish mythology is/was
practically non-existent and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dare claim the parts that made it into
Marvel comicbooks count. The book itself I ended up being kinda meh on. I
think it&amp;rsquo;s written well while still being more crass and gory than I expected.
There also aren&amp;rsquo;t many happy or fun stories in there which is something I&amp;rsquo;ve
kinda expected since despite the rampant awfulness that exists in probably all
mythologies, from the Norse, Roman, and Greek mythologies I remembered some
stories that at least had some funny or silly aspects to it. Whereas The
Morrigan is mostly a compendium of men being awful. I&amp;rsquo;m happy I read it and
having learned a bit more about Irish mythology. But I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend it
as a happy, entertaining read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science</title>
      <link>https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/charleswheelan-nakedeconomicsundressingthedismalscience-2019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I go this book originally because I wanted to start getting a better
understanding of economics as a field. Something I&amp;rsquo;ve shied away from through
most of my university years because it was hardly ever talked about in a way
that wasn&amp;rsquo;t either extremely obnoxious or extremely boring. Reading through
the book I kinda alternated between &amp;ldquo;yes this seems obvious&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;they are
doing what??&amp;rdquo; depending on the topic. But in general it&amp;rsquo;s very well written
and does a good job conveying economic ideas in plain English that is easy to
understand. The chapters generally are structured in a way that first
it is emphasized that ideally the market shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be regulated and then
following up on this with a more nuanced explanation of why regulation and
government influence and rule making still is needed to some extent for the
whole thing to work. I would definitely recommend it even though even though I
felt triggered a couple of times early in chapters before the more nuanced
progression took place :).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I ordered &lt;a href=&#34;../reading/raymondbenson-metalgearsolid-2008/&#34;&gt;the first Metal Gear Solid book&lt;/a&gt; I also ordered the second
one at the same time. And I will say that it reads much the same way. I
personally find the story of the Metal Gear Solid 2 video game less exciting
than the first one as well. I also never played it as a kid so it&amp;rsquo;s missing a
ton of nostalgia for me as well. But the second book basically is written in
the same style than the first one. It was an easy read but not something I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily recommend unless you are a huge MGS fan and want to
consume literally everything that exists in that universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&#34;../reading/melaniemitchell-artificialintelligence-2019/&#34;&gt;about the technology of AI&lt;/a&gt; I decided to stay with the topic
for a bit longer and also read more about the impacts of the technology and
its deployment on the world outside of plainly looking at the outputs of
the algorithms. Much of it I already knew but the book very clearly looks at
the aspects of environmental as well as human and societal impact of these
technologies for mass data gathering and processing. It&amp;rsquo;s very well written
and recommended even though it&amp;rsquo;s not fun to read about this very dark aspect
of our current age of technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/melaniemitchell-artificialintelligence-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got this book in order to get a more nuanced idea about current approaches
to what&amp;rsquo;s generally being called &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo;. And especially to read more about the
basic of neural nets since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of lecture content about it in
university. The book does a really good job of explaining the history of the
field of artificial intelligence and the different cycles of excitement it has
gone through. The author also explains very well the basics of historical and
modern AI technologies and how e.g. images and text are being ingested and
evaluated. The book makes it very clear that tools like neural nets are
automatic classification tools and not more. The book is highly recommended if
you want an understanding of the field without the hype and fantastic claims
that have become so rampant in the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got this recommend by a friend as I had just finished &lt;a href=&#34;../reading/cassandraclare-cityofbones-2017/&#34;&gt;City of Bones&lt;/a&gt; and
wanted something similar in some regards.  And the fact that it was set on the
backdrop on some old Russian folk stories was kinda interesting. And overall
the book really held up. The first 100 pages were really slow, mostly
depressing, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to really keep track of the characters. But
after that I was really drawn into the story, to the point where some parts I
found creepy enough that I stopped reading it before going to bed and read it
in daylight instead 😅. I finished the final 150 pages or so in one setting
because I really wanted to know how it ends. And then immediately ordered the
two follow up books in the series.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was really curious about this book as I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot lately about
my use of technology, the amount of data that is tracked on devices, and just
the general state of software (and hardware) where a lot things seem to be
getting developed more for the purpose of keeping people hooked and
participating in a closed platform rather than mostly offering a useful
service or a solution to an actual problem. The book overall is definitely a
challenging read at times as it&amp;rsquo;s often written in fairly academic language
(the disclaimer here being that English isn&amp;rsquo;t my first language and I don&amp;rsquo;t
have a degree in the humanities, so ymmv) which made me re-read some sentences
occasionally to get to the gist of it. But overall it was a really interesting
book that gave me a lot of new ideas and avenues to think about my
relationship with technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this at the local book store and wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what to make of it
but found it interesting enough to buy. I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled in complexity theory
topics over the years but haven&amp;rsquo;t really dug deep into it so far.  I overall
really enjoyed the book. It does a good job introducing the basics of
complexity in my opinion and guiding through a lot of historical developments
in math and related fields in relation to the study of complexity. Which also
makes up the majority of the book. The part when the author actually gets to
consciousness is rather short and is more a starting point than a real outline
of their research in my mind. So while I can&amp;rsquo;t say I have a more interesting
insight into consciousness after reading the back, I still took a lot away
from reading it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I honestly devoured and thoroughly enjoyed this book. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been going
back to leaning on my notebooks a lot more for a lot of my tasks including
planning and todos (both at work and personal). So the book just came at the
right time. I gives a wonderful overview over how paper (and notebooks) were
used throughout the centuries by different people of various professions. It
was really interesting to compare how much of these ways of journaling and
taking notes is still in use today and how the question of organization of
notes kinda still has so many approaches. If you like writing on paper, I can
absolutely recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started this book many years ago after I had finished watching the Netflix
show and really was kinda bummed it ended. So I wanted to continue spending
time in that phantasy universe. Initially however I didn&amp;rsquo;t super enjoy the
differences between the book and the show (as I really wanted to have it make
the show keep going for me) and I had the book on my nightstand for a long
time without actually reading it. But then I decided to pick it back up - with
some good distance from the Netflix show - and just read it as its own. And I
thoroughly enjoyed it and finished it pretty quickly. I also got the follow up
book already, so I&amp;rsquo;m intending to keep going. If you like young adult stories
set within a universe of vampires, demons, werewolves, and other fantastical
creatures, I can recommend the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a long time fan of a lot of the music that Rick Rubin has produced I was
really curious about his take on creativity and the pursuit of making art. And
there were a lot of interesting bits in there. I found his views on the
pressure to make something that will be popular and how to approach
experimentation really interesting. And also the contrast of emphasizing the
more structured parts like note taking and practicing was very interesting.
Overall I think the book could&amp;rsquo;ve been a lot shorter as some parts felt
repetitive in some ways. And of course it mostly leaves out the challenges of
making a living with art. But I still overall enjoyed the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon this in a bookshop and while I knew about Bikini Kill, I can&amp;rsquo;t
say I had listened to a lot of their music before. So I was really curious
what their lead singer&amp;rsquo;s memoir would be like. And even though it has a lot of
hard to read and sad passages I really liked this book. There is so much raw
realness in there and so many interesting passages about their first gigs, the
struggle to keep the band and the zines and all the stuff around it going,
their history with Kurt Cobain, and a lot of sweet details from their
relationship with Ad-Rock from the Beastie Boys. I really enjoyed the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had read books by Olga Grjasnowa before and really liked her style and view
on the topics like migration and multi-lingualism. So I started reading this
book on winter break and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really prepared for the how real and rough
this story is. It details a lot of the cruelties that happen to the
protagonists during mid-2010s Syria and their route to flee the country. It
took me some struggling to get through it but also gave me a lot of additional
perspective on the realities of living in a country that often struggles with
the question of whether and how many refugees to take in. It&amp;rsquo;s not an easy
read but I can recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not really concerned myself in depth with the Israel-Palestine conflict
much before. But with all the recent events I wanted to educate myself a bit
more and got this book to read from some people that live there. And I found
the book to be very interesting. Especially the contrast between the letters
written by the author and then the reply letters by Palestinians that are
added in this edition give a good idea about the contrasting (and sometimes
similar) views on the various topics of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was super curious about this book. The combination of maths and maps
immediately captured my attention, having been interested in both for a long
time. And I absolutely loved the book. It expectedly goes into detail of the
mathematics to make projections of 3D territory on a 2D plane works and what
the trade-offs are there. But then goes so much wider into (often no well
known) pioneers of map making and how drawing maps can help people but also
have impact on politics in other areas as we essentially draw arbitrary lines
around territories to categorize them. If you like maps and maths I can highly
recommend the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

giving a talk at a conference before but my knowledge of Africa is still very

with a lot of no-nonsense historical details and tons of humor. I learned a
lot about the history of the continent as well as some of it countries and
culture. Can highly recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who has played the original Metal Gear Solid game multiple times on
the first Playstation as well as the Switch and has fond childhood memories of
the story I was curious how it could or would translate to a book. And I can
say I definitely wasn&amp;rsquo;t impressed. The book is written fairly cringy, and
especially the way the boss fights had to be adapted to a book was awkward at
times. And often times it feels like pages needed to be filled by mentioning
the full name, number, and make of the weapons Snake is using - almost missing
the serial number as well. I don&amp;rsquo;t regret reading it but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call it
good literature either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon this book in the book store and was immediately intrigued by
this idea of &amp;ldquo;winter&amp;rdquo; as a global but also personal season of struggle, death,
and renewal. The author shares a lot of personal stories of struggle and
accommodating the inevitable in her life. And the idea that a lot of people
try to pretend winter isn&amp;rsquo;t happening or at least wishing for months that it
was summer. Which is something that rings very true for me as someone who
routinely falls into a winter depression around January when it&amp;rsquo;s been cold
and grey for more than 2 months here in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this book at my favourite book store and was really interested in it
without knowing too much about it. I initially thought it was more about
actually building things. But the book turned out to be more like listening to
an old carpenter reminiscing about life. Which I thoroughly enjoyed. I come
from a line of car mechanics and carpenters and it reminded me a lot of
talking to my dad or grandpa. The book is divided into chapters on various
topics around life. And usually a lot of them have examples from houses the
author built. Lots of them including the fanciest apartments of New York. Many
stories reminded me of just general vibes in project management even in
software engineering. But also stories I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from carpenters and other
engineers. There&amp;rsquo;s a chapter about &amp;ldquo;Friendship and Death&amp;rdquo; that made me very
emotional and I actually stopped reading there for a bit. But I can definitely
overall recommend it if &amp;ldquo;old carpenter talks about life&amp;rdquo; is a vibe you&amp;rsquo;d
enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was intrigued by the title when I saw the book in the bookshop as
counterfactuals are something that is seen as not desired in the process of
learning from incidents. So I was really curious how this can serve as a
probably different perspective and interpretation in other sciences. The book
is not a completely easy read and there are definitely dense parts in
understanding the more complex topics like quantum information and heat/work
like transfers. But I can definitely say the book opened my mind to thinking
about capabilities rather than dynamic law like rules of systems and it&amp;rsquo;s
something I still chew on, especially in relation to learning from incidents
and analyzing complex systems to learn from their failures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But I already liked the author and we were thinking about gifting this book so
I wanted to read it first to know what it&amp;rsquo;s about. And I really enjoyed it.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great fantasy story suitable for children around the age of 10-12. It
has some scary parts but is overall very joyous and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading this book thoroughly. I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Germany almost all
of my life and yet most of the things I have read and have influenced my
thinking around topics like integration, diversity, migration, race,
discrimination, and related topics have been in English and often centered on
the US. It was really interesting and good to read a book about the topic in
German by a German author who also has the background of being German. It&amp;rsquo;s a
quick but deep and thought provoking book that touches on many topics around
how categories are erected to try and tightly define people and their being.
Can definitely recommend reading it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

threw me off a couple of times. The writing style changes a lot throughout the
chapters and the topics do as well which is something I personally often have
a hard time following along with. Which also meant it took me quite some time
to finish it. But I overall enjoyed it and there is quite a lot of text about
finding (defining?) one&amp;rsquo;s purpose and identity amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this book and its thorough focus on the biological and
nutritional aspects of nurturing the brain. Especially the very thorough
breakdown of which foods contain which nutrients and how and when they benefit
the brain. For my taste the fairly uncritical recommendations of alcohol
(specifically red wine) and taking at face value the validity of &amp;ldquo;blue zones&amp;rdquo;
and centennials (especially after the data seems to be less robust than
previously assumed) as a proof for nutritional choices was less scientific
than it could be. But in my mind didn&amp;rsquo;t retract from the interesting rest of
the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

the book.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really like these kind of &amp;ldquo;quick lessons in science&amp;rdquo; style books where
different chapters talk about a specific topic. And this book is no
difference. The basic setup is a day in the author&amp;rsquo;s life where everyday
things like drinking coffee, brushing teeth, or charging the phone are being
used to illustrate the chemistry behind how it works and debunk some common
misconceptions along the way. The book is very entertaining and an absolute
fun and educating read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon this book somewhere on the internet and ordered it pretty
immediately as I thought it would be a good way to get more exposure into some
realities of trans life. And given this isn&amp;rsquo;t my lived experience - so I don&amp;rsquo;t
have first hand knowledge of things - and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have my trans
friends have to explain too many, often very painful, experiences to me, I was
happy to have another way to educate myself on my reading list. The book
itself was very informative albeit very UK centered (which is fine and I knew
beforehand). It touches on a lot of the frequently discussed topics of bodies,
transitioning, the role of society and the state, class struggles, and much
more. It also gave me some good input and perspectives to examine my own view
on things. While I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert on the topic by any means I can definitely
recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had this book on my reading list for years at this point and never quite got
to it. I actually already had it on my Kindle in like 2015 or so and then
bought a paper copy a couple of years ago after I had gotten rid of the
Kindle. So this year I finally made the time to read it. And I super enjoyed
it. It gives a very good theoretical framework to think about design and how
to distinguish good from bad design. It goes also goes into detail on a range
of other topics like human biases, the business of design, and the role of
feedback and discoverability in design. I took a lot of notes while reading
this book and it let me look at design in a very different light.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this at the bookstore and bought it on a whim since I had already read
his book 4000 weeks and really liked it. &amp;ldquo;The Antidote&amp;rdquo; starts with making fun
of &amp;ldquo;positivity seminars&amp;rdquo; and explains why forbidden yourself to think about
something doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. And then gives a kind of all around summary of some of
the ways people have dealt with hard topics like pain, negative outcomes of
events, inevitability, and death. And still managed to be happy (for whatever
that means). There are some well known approaches like stoicism and Buddhism
explained in there and even approaches to specifically death like the &amp;ldquo;day of
the dead&amp;rdquo; celebrations in Mexico. Some of these weren&amp;rsquo;t new to me so I kinda
knew what to expect there but the book still was very entertaining and
interesting and a good read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I preordered this book immediately when I saw it flying by in my Mastodon
stream. I&amp;rsquo;ve long been interested in infrastructure and especially having
worked in tech infrastructure for a long time I love thinking about how to
provide good services and utilities. The book was actually a lot different
from what I expected. I somehow thought there was more in depth discussions of
the inner workings of different types of infrastructure. But what I got
instead was way better. The book is a fantastic ode to infrastructure and does
a great job conveying the kind of fascination I&amp;rsquo;ve had with it for a long
time. But it also goes even further. It talks a lot about the kind of contexts
in which infrastructure was and is built. And how it furthers general
assumptions about who benefits in what ways from it. And there is also a lot
of focus on climate change, both how infrastructure is a contributing factor
in it and how it can be part of a more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book was a very fun read. I&amp;rsquo;ve read a bunch of physics related books in
the last couple of years. And while I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to deeply understand any of
it, the topic still keeps being interesting to me. The way the book is
structured and the lectures are delivered is also very engaging. One of my
favourite parts being the relation of physics to other sciences which is
outlined as relationship of building on each others knowledge and feeding back
information that can be useful to further progress. Rather than what&amp;rsquo;s often
communicated as physics being &amp;ldquo;the most fundamental science&amp;rdquo;. It was
refreshing to hear that from such a renowned physicists like Feynman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Engineering a Safer World: Systems Thinking Applied to Safety</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was very torn reading this book as it is a lot more slow going than I
expected. A lot of the discussions felt very drawn out and like they could&amp;rsquo;ve
been explained with a lot fewer words. That being said especially the early
chapters are rich with rethinking incidents and approaches to safety. There&amp;rsquo;s
a lot of good discussion about viewing our complex systems through the lens of
systems engineering and getting away from single cause sequential accident
models and stopping at human error to declare an incident &amp;ldquo;solved&amp;rdquo;. A lot of
the book also talks about hazard analysis and setting up process to have
analysis be part of designing and maintaining systems. I don&amp;rsquo;t generally work
in safety critical systems on the level of aerospace and chemical plants
(anymore). So this part was less interesting to me and I had a bit of hard
time getting through it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Overall I got a lot of interesting inspiration from the book though. And even
though I was already familiar with the ideas of emergent behaviour,
non-sequential accident models, and learning from complex socio-technical
systems, there was still a lot of angles that spurred my interest to go deeper
on. And the bibliography of the book to me was a rich source of things I want
to read next.</p>

      <title>Meaningful Availability</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SLOs the way they are usually constructed heavily bias towards the most active
user. This isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a good representation of the overall customer
impact of an incident. In order to address that, a mechanism called &amp;ldquo;windowed
user-uptime&amp;rdquo; is introduced to make the measure of user impact more

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SLOs the way they are usually constructed heavily bias towards the most active
user. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a good representation of the overall customer
impact of an incident. In order to address that, a mechanism called &ldquo;windowed
user-uptime&rdquo; is introduced to make the measure of user impact more
representative.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-discussion">Detailed discussion</h2>
<p>The paper starts with an introduction of the usual approach for SLOs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Success- ratio is the fraction of the number of successful requests to total requests over a period of time (usually a month or a quarter) [” (Diwan et al., 2020, p. 1)</p></blockquote>
<p>This plain calculation has the advantage that it&rsquo;s very easy to calculate but comes with the bias of skewing towards most active users as they will represent more requests (successful as well as unsuccessful) in the overall ratio.</p>
<p>The general form of availability metrics are defined as</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>availability = good service / total demanded service
</code></pre><p>And the way service is measured here generally falls in one of two buckets. Either time based which means the time between failures is uptime and the time recovering from a failure is downtime. Which leads to a metric defined as</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>availability = uptime / (uptime + downtime)
</code></pre><p>This measure strongly relies on the definition and precise meaning of &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;. Especially given situations of partial failure, the definition on whether failure means for all users or at least one user or something in between becomes important for the result of what it means for measuring availability. Here percentage thresholds are often introduced for the definition, to be able to say something like &ldquo;failure means at least 5% of users encounter errors&rdquo;. Which still comes with the problem of an arbitrary threshold. Within this definition a system with 5% error rate is treated the same as one with 0.0001% error rate given the chosen threshold as the delineation line. And the general downsides of this measure are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s not proportional to the severity of the system&rsquo;s unavailability</li>
<li>not proportional to users affected</li>
<li>not actionable with not insight into source of failures</li>
<li>not meaningful as they rely on arbitrary thresholds and/or manual judgements</li>
</ul>
<p>For the other approach of <em>count based</em> availability which is much more rare and is based on the similar definition of</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>availability = successful requests / total requests
</code></pre><p>There is some popularity to this approach as it is easy to implement. However users ultimately care about time they were able to use a service and not the number of requests they were able to do. So this approach also comes with the downsides of:</p>
<ul>
<li>not meaningful as it&rsquo;s not based on time</li>
<li>being biased towards highly active users</li>
<li>being biased due to different client behaviour during outages
There is a quick discussion of synthetic probes for measuring system availability but this isn&rsquo;t really discussed deeply as it comes with the downsides of not being representative of user activity and not proportional to what users experience. So for the goals of meaningful measure of uptime it&rsquo;s not a good fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to improve on these</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t really think I got the gist of this book. It had the usual barrier to
understanding that I’ve kinda come to expect from early 20th century
philosophy texts. There is a lot of talking about film specifically and how it
enables misuse of media. And when it comes to the reproducibility of art it’s
mostly said that the “aura” of it gets lost. I&amp;rsquo;m likely gonna do a second pass
of it at some point maybe with some relevant secondary literature in hand
because I feel like there is more I can get from this text. Especially since
there were many parts in there that lamented the dissolving distinction
between author and audience. And the fact that &amp;ldquo;everyone these days can
publish whatever they think they have to say&amp;rdquo;. Which feels very similar to a
lot of discourse today about content creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I deeply enjoyed this book. I’ve had many discussions about Klein’s ideas and
concepts before. I have for example applied his idea of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gary-klein.com/premortem&#34;&gt;premortems&lt;/a&gt; a lot
before in architectural and operational reviews of technology changes. And his
ideas about knowledge of expert workers is an important part of how I approach
incident reviews and learning from them. The book is also an interesting
opposite view in a lot of ways to Kahneman’s classic &lt;a href=&#34;https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/kahnemann-thinkingfastandslow-2011/&#34;&gt;“Thinking, Fast and
Slow”&lt;/a&gt; where a lot of emphasis is put on how the human mind can be tricked
or is wrong. I took tons of notes from this book and there were so many things
that reminded me of operating web services or planning and maintaining other
complex systems. Definitely a strong recommendation to read from me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book was a surprisingly quick and easy read. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure if I
was gonna like another book about taking notes (or find it useful) after
reading &lt;a href=&#34;../reading/ahrens-smartnotes-2017/&#34;&gt;How to take smart notes&lt;/a&gt; had comparatively little practical things
for me to take away from and implement. But &amp;ldquo;Building a Second Brain&amp;rdquo; was very
different in that regard. The book puts a lot of focus on building a system
that is very flexible and adaptable even to stressful schedules. There are a
couple of guiding principles (the PARA folder structure, refining notes
regularly, making it easy to capture notes) that are elaborated on. But there
is a lot of emphasis on making this work in even tiny moments throughout the
week. A lot of the system and ideas reminded me of bullet journaling in a way
which I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing for years at this point and has been working very well
for me&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember how I got to this book as I had never heard of Judith Butler
before given I’ve not really had any philosophy or literature classes on a
higher education level and haven’t read much about academic feminist or gender
theory. So I went into this book pretty unprepared and I was immediately in
for a rude awakening. I’ve always thought of my English being pretty decent
for a second language but there were so many sentences in this book that even
on the third try I wasn’t able to grasp. The fact I haven’t read Freud, Lacan,
Foucault, or any of the other works that “Gender Trouble” discusses and bases
a lot of arguments on definitely also didn’t help. Only while I was already
somewhat deep in did I find out that Butler is somewhat notorious for having a
difficult and dense writing style. Nevertheless I stayed curious enough about
the topic to get through the book and it was definitely interesting. I had
heard of gender being a social performance before but reading it in a more
academic context and having more (albeit difficult to grasp) discussion around
it was pretty insightful for me. I don’t know if I’d recommend it unless
you’re really into the topic and have maybe read some of the referenced
material. But I don’t regret reading and struggling through it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw this book in my regular bookstore and the topic really interested me. So
I started reading the book with no preconception or notion of who the author
was. Only halfway through or so I found out she also has a somewhat popular
YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Reading the book was a bit of a split for me. The author definitely does a
good job (as far as I can tell) explaining physics concepts and theories in a
way that is understandable and with the given topic in mind. And the fact that
the book is structured as chapters where each answers a specific question also
makes it a really quick and interesting read. However there have also been
parts of the book where the tone bordered on obnoxious for me with the cliche
undertone (or sometimes even explicit statement) that eventually everything
can “just” be explained with physics and how - in the author’s view - many
people (even other scientists) are incorrect in their assumptions and world
views. Which I find more jarring than entertaining. But the core idea in the
book that there are some views (e.g. the existence of a god) that are neither
scientific nor un-scientific as they can’t be proven or disproven. But rather
a-scientific as they are compatible with current science since nothing we
currently know confirms or refutes them. I’ve found this to be a really good
frame for thinking about the world. Overall I enjoyed the book with some
caveats.</p>

      <title>What is Existentialism?</title>
      <link>https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/debeauvoir-whatisexistentialism-2021/</link>

      <guid>https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/debeauvoir-whatisexistentialism-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was another book that I didn’t really have any expectations on when I
bought it. And having never really had any philosophy classes in school or
university there was definitely a certain challenge to reading this. Maybe
some of it was also the translation from French but not being used to the way
philosophers talk about topics and structure their sentences it often took me
more than reading a sentence once to understand what was being said. I don’t
think I’ve really understood what existentialism is after reading the book on
a level where I would be able to argue about it. However there were many
interesting ideas in there about what it means to live in the present and even
such grim topics like the (far) future always presenting death and how to
think about and live with that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had this book on my shelf since 2020 or so and never took the time to read
it. With the renewed (and intensified) hype around AI this year I started to
read it even though I wasn’t sure if there was really more about machine
learning that I wanted to know and would find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

learning that I wanted to know and would find interesting.</p>
<p>But truth be told I really enjoyed reading this book. It’s roughly divided
into topical areas like justice, medicine, cars, and art and discusses the
status quo (as of 2020) as well as improvements and downsides to the rise of
usage of algorithms in general but also machine learning. The author takes a
very nuanced look at all these and it actually made me feel less frustrated
about using computers in some areas than I had been through the public
discussions of AI this year. Highly recommend the book.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting this book I was a little set back as the author identifies with what
would have been called the “center-right” towards the late 1990s and early
2000s. So I wasn’t too sure where this book would be going. But I ended up
finding it super interesting. The book details some historical background as
well as current workings of politics in various countries like Poland,
Hungary, and the U.K.. There is also a lot of very personal accounts in there
about how friends of the author have drifted more towards the contemporary
right and how that feels. It was overall a pretty harrowing account of what
has happened in some countries over the past 20 years and how much similarity
there is between them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what to think of this book. I generally enjoyed reading
it. But I think I was expecting something different. I wasn’t expecting more
of a memoir of a friendship but rather thought there was some more general
discussion of the topic of friendship in there. Some parts of the book I
wasn’t super excited by as it either went into a lot of detail about social
outings I didn’t find super interesting or stopped before I felt it went to
the core of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Overall I liked the book. The big core message of friendship on a deep level
also takes work is something that really resonates with me. There’s too often
the message in media and entertainment that the perfect relationship (romantic
or otherwise) is effortless, which does us all a disservice as we assume we
don’t have to put the work in. But this book talks very clearly about the work
being part of a friendship and I really liked that.</p>

      <title>The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read (and Your Children Will Be Glad That You Did)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I liked a lot how the book always came back to talking to the kids and
empathizing with their emotions instead of trying to abolish them. And there
were always good examples that came with every section to illustrate the
point. However it still felt very &amp;ldquo;good weather parenting&amp;rdquo; advice to me, in
the sense that it talks about how to do these things when you have the time to
take for it. But there was hardly anything in there about how to deal with
situations where time is tight or there isn&amp;rsquo;t the space to slow down and
prolong the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was fun to read through this book and see different approaches to solving
the problems presented. I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow through all the proofs and steps all
the time because I would have needed to carefully do it with pen and paper and
that was really the mood I was in when I wanted to read. But it made me miss
school math and solving problems a lot. It also ended up being a bit hard to
follow for me occasionally as I read the book in English and most of my math
education was in German. So there were definitely words and terms I wasn&amp;rsquo;t
familiar with at all. Overall I enjoyed reading it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I absolutely enjoyed this book and devoured it in 2 days or so. Janna Levin
has a fantastically fun and entertaining way to talk about the most
fascinating things. And black holes sure are fascinating. There were a lot of
parts in the book where I was sure I&amp;rsquo;m not getting quite the importance of the
implications she explained. Or even the science on the highest of levels. But
I enjoy thinking about space. And the book did exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this book. Mostly because I rarely have read any texts, let
alone feminist ones from a Muslim women perspective. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things I
learned having previously had close to no knowledge of Islam, its traditions,
or which are practiced. The book is very UK centric as most of the essay
authors live there. So I&amp;rsquo;m curious to also read more from authors from other
places.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really liked the book. It was short and digestible but interesting and fun
to read nonetheless. I think I probably have read about most of the seven
things somewhere else before (which doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I understood or have a good
grasp on them). So it wasn&amp;rsquo;t mind blowing new things I was reading. But
Rovelli has a very philosophical style how he talks about these things which
makes it really enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had originally started reading this on my Kindle in 2016 but quickly
abandoned it. I then thought it was because I didn&amp;rsquo;t find the book too
interesting but I found out some time later that I just didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy reading
on the Kindle much. So having moved to reading exclusively on paper over the
last couple of years, I gave the book another try this year and absolutely
enjoyed it. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fascinating facts and insights into research in
there. And a lot of examples to try out yourself to realize that your own
brain works the same way. I took a lot of notes for this one and can
definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went into this book expecting much more physics than what was actually in
there. There was definitely a lot of explanation of concepts on a high level.
But overall the book felt much more on the philosophy side of things. Which -
after realizing and getting used to it - I really liked. The thing I struggled
with was the fact that so much is explained via entropy in the book. And
entropy has always been a hard topic for me to wrap my brain around. Even in
university. So there were some parts that left me more confused than I would
have liked. Due to no fault of the author.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to get through this book which had less to do with the book
itself and more with how I was able to make time to read. So the first couple
of chapters were spread out for me over a couple of weeks and thus I had a
hard time getting into it. But once I managed to make proper time to read
continuously I really enjoyed the flow of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s much less
mathematical than I assumed beforehand. But it&amp;rsquo;s really well written and does
a good job explaining statistical concepts in plain English. And I really
appreciated the strong focus on the fact that (good) statistics is more than
just applying some formulas but also a hard look at whether the data and the
conclusions make sense for the questions that need to be answered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read this book after Mathias really enjoyed it and Nina finding the audio
book pretty insufferable. Which is an interesting combination to say the
least. Overall I did enjoy the book a lot. Even though I could definitely see
the preachy and more annoying parts of it. The general message of the books is
that we don&amp;rsquo;t actually have that many weeks, so it&amp;rsquo;s worth it to think about
how to spend them. What kind of things actually are enjoyable (of the things
that we do voluntarily) and which things we can more or less do away with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this book while browsing through the local book store. And I found it
really intriguing because even though cancer seems to be everywhere and all
around us in some ways and I&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of friends and family suffer
through and even die of cancer, it&amp;rsquo;s not something I&amp;rsquo;ve personally
experienced. Especially not going through a mastectomy as a black, queer woman
in the 70s. So I was interested in reading a personal account of something
that I will never actually experience myself. And I&amp;rsquo;m very glad I did. Lorde
talks very directly and openly about the struggle she went through, the
adversaries she faced, as well as the things that helped her through. I can
very much recommend reading it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to read this book after I had read &lt;a href=&#34;../reading/grjasnowa-machtdermehrsprachigkeit-2021&#34;&gt;Die Macht der
Mehrsprachigkeit&lt;/a&gt; earlier
this year. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read a lot of German literature (let alone fiction) since
I was in school for no real reason. So I was curious about some more
contemporary authors. And the book really wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy read. It&amp;rsquo;s a very
emotional and not often happy story and deals with a lot of heavy topics
around war, migration, loss, and what it means to be and have a home.
Nonetheless I flew through its nearly 300 pages in about 2 days. And I was sad
when I was done as I wanted to keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was an absolutely fascinating book to read. For every city that the
author visits throughout the book and talks to people I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to see them
(and I&amp;rsquo;ve been to a good chunk of them) in a new light. And made me reflect
about a lot of things. I can whole-heartedly recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took me quite a while to get through this book. I had actually abandoned it
before and then came back to it. It&amp;rsquo;s very theoretical and academic (even
though it contains some suggestions towards more practical applications of the
theory towards the end). There is a lot of interesting thought in there about
how to put something more concrete to the notion of errors or mistakes. And
even if most of it is now superseded it provides interesting insight into the
research of human error during that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given this book is more or less the printed and published version of Arrow&amp;rsquo;s
PhD. thesis, it is not an easy read. It lays the foundation and explanation
for his &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem&#34;&gt;Impossibility
Theorem&lt;/a&gt;
which states limitations of a ranked voting electoral systems when it comes to
individual and communal preferences. I can&amp;rsquo;t claim to have understood all of
it fully. It was nevertheless very interesting to me, so read something from a
field I have hardly any experience or knowledge in. I started reading it
earlier in the year and then put it down because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the brain space
to get into the math and proofs of it. And then I picked it back up during the
time of the German general election this year. I found it really interesting
to read about how these kind of problems are described and reasoned about in
political and economical academia. And which kind of definitions and trade
offs are being chosen to create a system within these formal proofs can exist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed reading this book. For years at this point I&amp;rsquo;ve felt like a
bilingual in German and English, and I&amp;rsquo;ve come across so many situations where
I unconsciously chose one language over the other. And then was surprised by
it. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wondered how bilingualism or multilingualism is reflected in
the brain and how it&amp;rsquo;s different between people and languages. &amp;ldquo;The Bilingual
Brain&amp;rdquo; gives a ton of insight into the research field of multilingulism as
well as highlighting the approaches, challenges, and limitations of research
in this field. There were many situation in the book, when a common pattern
for bilinguals was explained, where I was happy to realize it&amp;rsquo;s something I do
to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was an absolutely fantastic, emotional, gut-wrenching, sad,  and happy
book to read. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to really like the way it is written, as a
conversation between the author and his son, trying to explain the world.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of mixing of history, current affairs, personal history and
memories, which makes for a very personal piece of literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

how it would best serve me after reading the basics of the theory behind it in
&lt;a href=&#34;../reading/ahrens-smartnotes-2017&#34;&gt;Taking Smart Notes&lt;/a&gt;. And there sadly wasn&amp;rsquo;t much new stuff in the
book that I haven&amp;rsquo;t already read in various forms in some blog posts over the
last couple of months. However it was really nice to have this information all
in one place in book form. And get the confirmation that I am on the right
track with how I&amp;rsquo;m building my Zettelkasten. Or at least going in the same
direction that has worked for others so far as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy</title>

      <guid>https://unwiredcouch.com/reading/odell-howtodonothing-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was one of those books that I started reading with a lot of expectations
that it would be similar to &lt;a href=&#34;../reading/newport-digitalminimalism-2019/&#34;&gt;Newport&amp;rsquo;s Digital Minimalism&lt;/a&gt; and tell me a
lot of things that I already kinda knew. But I was completely surprised by it.
The book is much more about what to do &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of following the pull of the
attention economy, rather than why it&amp;rsquo;s bad. There is some of that in there as
well of course. However the fascinating part of the book is much more the fact
that it kinda acts like a nice guide about how to re-engage with your physical
surroundings, your city, countryside, and neighborhood. The real things around
you. It took me a while to realize that and read the book with that in mind.
And I definitely struggled early on as there was way more talk about the
dropout communities of the 70s that I really was interested in. But after
finishing the book I definitely have a new-found appreciation of my
neighborhood and the nature around me. It was a very positive read and in the
end not really about &amp;ldquo;doing nothing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this one by accident while shopping at the local bookstore.  The book
ended up being a super fascinating read about how language and multilingualism
is viewed in Germany. I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself reminded of a lot of things that I&amp;rsquo;ve
noticed since living abroad in the US and coming back to Germany. And it gave
me a new sense of reality of what it means to arrive and live in Germany as
someone who&amp;rsquo;s first language isn&amp;rsquo;t German and isn&amp;rsquo;t considered one of the
&amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; languages either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a very fascinating book. In part because I have never really attended
an economics lecture. And the ones I did were geared towards very practical
things that we had to learn by heart. So while reading this book I was at the
same time getting used to thinking about economic things in a theoretical
context and taking in the information conveyed in the text. I enjoyed it a lot
and took a lot of inspiration and food for thought from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went into this book with a lot of expectations. I was very curious about the
science behind meditation and how to approach the topic in a scientific way.
While ultimately that information was in the book to some extent, it overall
wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I had hoped it would be. First of all there is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of
namedropping happening. So for a quite some time I was busy with going back to
re-read who someone was, or wondering whether I should care to remember that
person&amp;rsquo;s name because it would be important later on. This is likely very
interesting to someone who is already familiar with well-known people in the
field of meditation but was mostly distracting for me. The tl;dr for the book
seems to be that there are still more questions than answers about the science
behind meditation and how to explain the clearly visible benefits with a lot
of long time practitioners. But to me that could have been a blog post and not
such a long book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

were a bunch of things that I had heard before and that made sense to me.
Especially thinking about the brain more as a network structure and less than
a set of connected control nodes.  And some of the findings wrt how changes in
different networks for different aspects of social life contribute to symptoms
that manifest in various external behaviors (e.g. being cold/distant to loved

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was an absolutely mind blowing read in the sense that it made me think
about a lot of things in a new light. The book is an introduction into &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constructed_emotion&#34; title=&#34;Theory of Constructed Emotion on Wikipedia.org&#34;&gt;the
theory of constructed emotion&lt;/a&gt; which has been the author’s field of
research for many years. The tl;dr kinda being that emotions don’t just exist
as objective reality but are constructed by humans as we interpret external
and internal sensor input.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

as objective reality but are constructed by humans as we interpret external

<p>The author makes it very clear how much research has gone into the theory and
how it explains many observations that can’t be explained by the classical
view on emotions. It’s definitely a theory that’s a lot less intuitive than
the classical view, but I’ve still found myself nodding along at some
passages, while being very perplexed at others trying to understand concepts
like simulation and prediction of the brain. And what it means for my day to
day perceptions.</p>

and I was very curious to learn more about it. Coming to the book with that
context, I didn’t mind the academic style of the book too much. However it’s
definitely more a book that makes you reflect on how you want to take notes
and why more than giving you a concrete guide on what to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>After finishing the book I took some time to think about how a Zettelkasten
style note taking setup would best fit into my day to day. And how I would
want to interact with such a setup. And I’m still in the process of moving my
old notes into the system and figuring out how it works out for me. So while I
can’t say anything yet about how effective the things are that I learned
through the book, I found it intriguing enough to make me adapt the method and
try it out.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought this book never really having watched any of Trevor Noah’s comedy or
The Daily Show with him. But the book sounded really intriguing to me and I
was curious about his life and background. And the book was absolutely
fantastic. It’s one of the few books I’ve read where I literally laughed out
lout while also being struck and deeply emotional reading through other parts.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only been to South Africa for a couple of days and only really been to
Cape Town. So I’ve had (and still have) very limited knowledge of the history
of the country. And the book taught me a ton about what it was like growing up
during and after Apartheid and how kids can perceive very extreme and cruel
situations. This is definitely one of the best books I’ve read and I can
wholeheartedly recommend picking it up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Daily Show with him. But the book sounded really intriguing to me and I
was curious about his life and background. And the book was absolutely
fantastic. It’s one of the few books I’ve read where I literally laughed out

      <title>Outlining your Novel: Map Your Way to Success</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I picked this book up because I’ve always been interested in outlining. But
even more so I’ve fascinated by how many people are fans of outlining. To the
point where there are discussion about things like “is OmniOutliner or OneNote
the better outlining app” and the point that there are even dedicated
outlining apps. I’ve mostly done outlining for my writing with bullet points
in a plain text or markdown file. And I wanted to know if I’m missing
anything. In addition to that I also find the process of writing a book or
novel super fascinating. I don’t know if I would want to write one. But the
process of planning, structuring, and writing something of that size I find
very interesting and fascinating. And I wanted to see if I could learn
something from it for shorter writing like documentation and blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

something from it for shorter writing like documentation and blog posts.</p>
<p>The book is structured in a way where only the first two chapters are really
about outlining itself. The advantages of writing an outline versus writing
“at the seat of your pants” as well as different approaches to outlines (e.g.
mind maps, longform writing, bullet points) are discussed.</p>
<p>The following chapters then are a whirlwind tour through planning a novel and
how to apply outlining to areas like plot planning, character development, or
creating a backstory. At the end of every chapter there is an interview with a
writer about the value and their approach in outlining.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed reading the book. I learned a lot about structuring my
writing and what kind of things go into planning a novel. It’s very accessibly
written and the chapters all have a good length so it never feels like they
are dragged out or missing content. I could have done without the writer
interviews as they didn’t really add a lot to the book but had a couple of
interesting anecdotes. I don’t know if there would be anything new for a
seasoned author in the book, but I can definitely recommend it as a quick
intro into planning a novel.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was interested in Eve Ewing’s writing ever since I read her run on Marvel’s
Ironheart. So I got her other books a couple of months ago as well. I started
with &amp;ldquo;1919&amp;rdquo; and it was definitely an interesting albeit completely new
experience for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve not really read poetry since school where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a
big fan because it always felt forced. But while reading &amp;ldquo;1919&amp;rdquo; I definitely
regretted not paying more attention in school to be able to pick up on the
stylistic and technique choices in the book. &amp;ldquo;1919&amp;rdquo; is a collection of poems
with the background of an official report about the 1919 race riots in Chicago
which I had never heard of until I read the book. It was absolutely
educational to read the various passages from the report that were the basis
for the poem. And then get an emotional and very personal feeling poem about
the passage right after. Given my own lack of knowledge about poetry I
constantly felt like I was missing some fascinating nuances about the writing.
And I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning more about poetry and creative writing to rectify
that. And I definitely plan to re-read &amp;ldquo;1919&amp;rdquo; once I&amp;rsquo;m more knowledgeable
about poetry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Draw People Every Day: Short Lessons in Portrait and Figure Drawing Using Ink and Color</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book caught my eye while I was browsing for art books. I’ve been trying
for a while to incorporate (almost) daily drawing back into my daily schedule.
But in a lighter weight way with less pressure to do finished pieces. And “Draw
People Every Day” definitely fit the bill for that. The book provides a great
high level overview for getting started with ink drawing and dives deeper into
various topics like e.g. the importance of drawing from life, gesture drawing
and how to achieve different effects with line weights. The same approach is
then taken in the final chapter to talk about using color for quick sketching.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>After having spent a lot of time on learning how to draw in the last 2 years,
there weren’t a lot of things that were really new to me in this book. However
it’s the book I wish I had 2 years ago when I got started. It does a great job
laying down the fundamentals for getting started with sketching. And it
definitely inspired me to do more quick sketching and drawing from life.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had heard about this book on several occasions and when we went to the
natural history museum here in Berlin I found it in the shop and decided to
finally buy it. I didn’t really know what to expect but having recently read a
couple of popular science books about physics I was very intrigued. And the
book did definitely deliver, albeit in a very different way than I thought. I
went into reading it with the expectation that the majority of the book would
be about dark matter and its details. This however is really only a small part
of the whole book. Throughout the book there are detailed explanations about
the (presumed) origins of life, the makeup of the cosmos, mass extinctions,
determining the age of rocks, history of scientific discoveries and methods,
dinosaurs, impact crater anatomy, why Pluto isn’t a planet anymore, why
meteroids as we call them often aren’t really meteroids, and much more. At the
end of the book the author then circles back to dark matter and some of the
recent theories and discoveries, tying all of the chapters together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I have to admit that occasionally while reading the book I was fascinated by
the things I was learning while at the same time not really knowing what it
has to do with dark matter. Nevertheless I extremely enjoyed this book and the
things I learned reading it.</p>

to read it. I didn’t really enjoy reading it much. It’s a good book and has a
lot of good points. But also a couple I disagree with. But having worked so
much in DevOps context, the book didn’t offer me anything new. More so some of
it actually is opposite to my experience. Which made it even harder to
continue reading it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Usually I tend to shy away from longer (i.e. over 300 pages) books because I

feel like I’m a somewhat slow reader. And it takes me too long to get through
and I feel demotivated to pick the book up. Sapiens still really piqued my
interest and it absolutely delivered.</p>
<p>The overall book is structured in chapters about the cognitive revolution, the
agricultural revolution, the unification of humankind, and the scientific
revolution. I’ve never thought about historical periods in that way and it was
interesting to see them presented in that way. The book covers the usual things
like evolution of Homo Sapiens with a bigger brain than other species, the
early periods as hunter gatherers, the emergence of agricultural and the
connected settling down.</p>
<p>The book also discusses cultural things like a common belief (e.g. religion or
capitalism) being a necessary establishment to allow for communication (and
collaboration to some extent) across larger territories than just family or
tribe boundaries. For any evolutionary step the trade-offs in those changes are
also discussed. Especially the cruel(-er) aspects of human dominance on the
planet.</p>
<p>I learned a lot reading this book and it definitely made me think about history
and human evolution from other perspectives than usual.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really liked especially the first part of the book that focuses on the

history of behavioral psychology and how in various stages scientists ran
different experiments to understand the psychology of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really liked especially the first part of the book that focuses on the
science and research of motivation. It was very interesting to read about the
history of behavioral psychology and how in various stages scientists ran
different experiments to understand the psychology of motivation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia’s triumph seems to defy the laws of behavioral physics</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the more prominent examples of intrinsic motivation in the book is
contribution to open source. At that part it shows that the book was written
over 10 years ago. Because the discussion of open source is solely focused on
the positive effects of honing skills, furthering one’s career through the
work, and the intrinsic “feel good” motivation of giving back and contributing.
However over the last 10 years the problem of burn out with open source
maintainers has become a major topic that is completely absent here. And there
is also no real acknowledgement of maintainers vs contributors and the
difference in demand, work, and rewards. But I don’t think that detracts from
the points the book is making, merely something I immediately jumped to when
reading these packages as some missing nuance in the argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; rewards can perform a weird sort of behavioral alchemy: They can transform an interesting task into a drudge. They can turn play into work</p></blockquote>
<p>Large parts of the book then deal with the detrimental effects of the “carrot
and stick” approach to management. It was interesting to read about flow state,
rewards, and how - depending on how they are used - they can be actually
detrimental to motivation. This part contained an interesting short lesson in
management history and that the idea of creating space for autonomy for workers
has come up a couple of times in the past but never got a lot of traction. And
that the new way of granting autonomy and letting workers have more urgency
over their work is improving motivation. However there are also a couple of
dangerous ideas the author arrives at. That can easily be read as management
being a problem, rather than the fact that it is a craft that needs to honed
just as any other work</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps management is one of the forces that’s switching our default setting and <em>producing</em> that state [of passive inertia]</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally there is a discussion about mastery and putting effort into something
that I found very interesting based on Carol Dweck’s - a psychology professor
at Stanford - research. The discussion of mastery being a mindset rather than a
set goal resonated a lot with me. Especially the idea that intelligence is not
a set entity within people but a resource that can be increased via learning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is the nature of mastery: Mastery is a mindset</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally the idea that mastery is an infinite pursuit. That even if you
spend a lifetime doing something, you can never truly master something. There
will always be more to learn, more to practice, more to &hellip; master.</p>
<p>Overall I really enjoyed the book. Even though there are definitely parts that
haven’t aged quite so well over the last 10 years and with all the things we’ve
learned from tech startups left and right misunderstanding the importance of
structure, management, and Human Resources. There were many parts that I really
enjoyed reading and learned a bunch of things from.</p>

(quantum) physics details went over my head. But I loved the discussion of its
implications on &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo; and the philosophy of being. It’s an extremely dense
read but I got so much out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I also found this one by accident while looking through the book store. It was
interesting to read a psychologist’s view on dealing with anxiety in kids. And
it turned out to be much more interesting and useful for its explanations of
general behaving towards children. The exercises are a bit too involved for me
to want to try them. But I can see them being useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to give this book a try after poking around at the local book store.
I realized I’ve never read a single Dostoyevsky. And I sure wasn’t gonna read
“War &amp;amp; Peace” just to give it a try and see how I like it. After some quick
googling it seemed like “Weiße Nächte” was one of his fairly popular works,
and they had it in the &lt;a href=&#34;(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclam&#34;&gt;Reclam&lt;/a&gt; version which is about 4 Euros. So not a
huge investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>So I read the whole thing with not a lot of expectations. And overall I didn’t
hate it. It was slightly obnoxious at times, and Dostoyevsky seems to
definitely have a thing for drama. Plus it has all the problems you can expect
from a man during the 19th century when it comes to respecting women. The
ending made up for a lot though.</p>

Solnit‘s „Men explain things to me“ a couple of years ago. And since I really

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed reading „A Field Guide to Getting Lost“ even though (or
maybe because of?) I often found myself getting lost myself in an essay and
wondering what&rsquo;s the point she&rsquo;s trying to be bring across. It was also at
times deeply emotional to read for me as I was reminded of personal loss (or
the fear of it) with many of her essays.</p>

that I was already sold on the concept of &ldquo;Digital Minimalism&rdquo; and thought
there wouldn’t be new or interesting things for me in there.</p>
<p>However once I started reading the book I immediately got sucked in and really
enjoyed it. The book is very well researched and there are a lot of references
to other works and research that are interesting to follow up on. It also
contains a good mix of background information and actionable things to do for
minimizing digital factors in once life. That makes it really easy (and
somewhat also creates the desire to try) to give the exercises for
minimization a spin.</p>
<p>My fear of already being sold on the concept and thus the book feeling like
preaching to me as the choir were completely unfounded. If anything I got a
confirmation and reaffirmation to my own practices of minimizing digital
influences on my life.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book gives a thorough introduction into logic and how to apply it. And I
really enjoyed the discussion of what kind of things can be applied, how to
build a logical structure and argument, and what the limits of a logical
argument are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book gives a thorough introduction into logic and how to apply it. And I
really enjoyed the discussion of what kind of things can be applied, how to
build a logical structure and argument, and what the limits of a logical
argument are.</p>
<p>I especially enjoyed the discussions of axioms as a kind of personal value
system. And thus the root of any logical reasoning that you apply to
arguments. This was the part for me that really tied the theoretical approach
of logic and the emotional and moral foundations of one’s own beliefs
together.</p>
<p>Overall however I wanted this book to be better. While I really enjoyed the
logic part, there was one thing that made it really hard for me to get into a
flow while reading. The author kept jumping between theory and examples way
too frequently for my taste. She also rarely used lighter &ldquo;introductory&rdquo;
examples. But most of the time jumped straight into heavy examples around
racism, sexism, and other topics like that. Which made it much harder for me
to get an understanding of the logical foundations as I was trying to keep the
theoretical ideas in my head while also dealing with the emotional reaction to
such heavy examples. I don’t think that those didn’t have a part in the book
at all, but rather for me it would have worked better to reserve these heavy
examples for the end. At which point I had familiarized myself with the
concepts that got introduced, had some simple examples to apply them, and
could focus on a more trying example as a completion of the topic.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while into learning how to draw I realized that watercolor is a lot more fun
and versatile than I thought it was from my experience using it in art class
in school. So I researched around and found this book recommended as a sort of
reference book for watercolor artists. And it’s exactly that. The book gives a
great overview over all the different aspects and techniques of using
watercolor. Reading it gave me a much better understanding of the medium and I
still refer back to it to look some things up occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to read this new edition of “A Brief History of Time”, which I had
started but never finished. I really enjoyed it even though most of it went
totally over my head. I read this book on the Kindle and mostly before going
to sleep. Which is not a good combination for reading a book with such an
intense topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I absolutely loved this book. It was more of a flip through and reading
individual chapters for me than a book I read front to back. The chapters
cover the author’s creative journey, some general advice for artists, art
fundamentals, character design, and even a chapter on managing a family life
while also making time and space for art. Every chapter and its sub sections
contain a ton of very helpful examples. All drawn in Simone Grünewald’s well
known style. So it’s easy to see how to approach faces, noses, hair, old and
young people. And even flora and fauna.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was pretty excited about this book. I used to follow Amber Case on social
media and she did some interesting early IoT stuff. But the book overall is
written with mostly anecdotal examples and not many directly practical things.
It also has some confusing layout quirks that occasionally makes it hard to
read. But content wise it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good if you’re new to the topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn’t much enjoy the book which might be due to expecting something
different. I didn’t have strong expectation but I wanted to get some more
background on where yoga is coming from and what else is part of it to enhance
my own yoga (and maybe meditation) practice. And I’ve definitely learned a
couple of things from the book. But those could have been summarized on 10
pages. The rest of the time I’ve felt the book to mostly be repetitive,
rambling, almost condescending at times, and even occasionally dangerously
wrong (e.g. there’s a section in which it’s said that inverted poses while
menstruating can lead to cancer).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>There are definitely good things in there about balance, not seeing yoga
practice as a competition, listening to your body, taking time, etc. But as a
fairly scientific person it’s hard to read over the parts where the last 100
years of modern medicine are ignored.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this book. As someone who has not been actively part of the
dotcom era, and has mostly been told about the bad sides of that time, it’s
refreshing to read something coming out of that time full of what are still
essentially progressive ideas today. Slack as the part of the work where
innovation happens vs the always on, always busy culture is something
organizations can still learn heaps from today. Definitely recommend reading
it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s really short, more of an essay really, so there’s no reason not to read

find out about oneself in order to be effective and successful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s really short, more of an essay really, so there’s no reason not to read
it. It gives a couple of really good and fairly practical tips about what to
find out about oneself in order to be effective and successful.</p>
<p>One of the things that definitely did strike me as interesting were Drucker’s
points about taking notes and writing things down in general:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I don’t write it down immediately, I forget it right away. If I put it
into a sketch book, I never forget it and I never have to look it up again</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve had this experience so frequently, especially as a kid in school. That
when I wrote something down (e.g. homework for the day) I rarely needed to
look it up again but remembered what I had to do. Because I would also often
remember it either way, I sadly drew the wrong conclusion there (namely that
writing things down isn’t worth the hassle). Which stifled my note taking
skills and a lot of my learning later on. It wasn’t until a couple of years
ago that I realized that it was precisely that process of writing things down
that made me memorize my homework.</p>
<p>A good part of the book also is about figuring out which version of yourself
you want to be. Which I think is a really important aspect of maturing as a
person and figuring out why you’re even trying to get better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is the mirror test. Ethics requires that you ask yourself, what kind of person do I want to see in the mirror in the morning?</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic book. It walks through many different facets of how
interfaces are causing people to have a hard time instead of being useful. And
looks at many different factors contributing to the status quo. I’ve
definitely spent a lot of time educating myself on the topic before and while
some things I already knew about, the book provided a great mix of new
information, different view points, and reminders for myself. I wholeheartedly
recommend this to anyone working in tech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve known Lara for years and have also been part of her organization for a bit

about management and leadership. So I’ve had a certain idea of what I could

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve known Lara for years and have also been part of her organization for a bit
when we worked at Etsy together. And over the years we have talked extensively
about management and leadership. So I’ve had a certain idea of what I could
expect from her book. And the book absolutely delivered!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a manager, one of your primary jobs is to foster a foundation of trust on your team</p></blockquote>
<p>In the book Lara gives invaluable insights about the human side of management.
About the fact that as a manager you are tasked with making a group of humans
work together. And that only works if you understand what humans value, how
they tick, and if you’ve put the work in to build and foster a foundation of
trust on your team.</p>
<p>This common thread of understanding humans and using that to be effective at
work (and to be honest also outside) guides you through the whole book . Be it
mentoring, coaching, sponsoring, providing (and receiving) feedback, or
communication. Every chapter is written with humans in mind. And that is what
makes this such an outstanding book. Throughout the chapters you will learn how
to meet your team, grow your team, set expectations, communicate effectively,
and build resilience. Every chapter is to the point, clearly written, and
extremely actionable.</p>
<p>This book is a must have regardless whether you are a manager, want to become a
manager, reporting to a manager, or just in general work with other humans.
Lara Hogan puts down so much useful insights and wonderfully helpful guiding
questions and suggestions that I don’t think there is anyone who wouldn’t
benefit from reading it.  Plus it’s about 100 pages long. You can literally
start reading this book on Friday and will be better equipped to do your job on
Monday.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book blew my mind (pun intended). There was so much neuropsychology in
there that explained so many things about the brain. So many things I always
wondered about made so much more sense now. I don’t know if it made me more
organized but I have a whole new perspective on attention, memory, sleep,
categorization, and so much more. This is one of those “game changer” books
for me. I am approaching many things in daily life and even about my inner,
emotional life very differently since reading the book. From how remembering
and recalling things works (as far as we know currently), to how sleep impacts
your brain, how categorization is done by humans (and why you will always end
up with a “junk drawer”), and when to not trust your gut. It’s a book I want
to read a second time because I don’t feel like I’ve fully taken it in yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very nice and easy read. Made me really think about slowing down for planning
and reflection. I read this book after having switched to a Bullet Journal for
daily logging and planning about 9 months prior. And it’s really easy to get
sucked into all the pretty and elaborate spreads with bullet journaling and
lose focus of what’s really important. The book does a really good job
focusing on the fundamentals with bullet journaling and how to think about
what to incorporate into your journaling practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book provides a great overview of how to run good retrospectives and
meetings in general. While all the recommendations and tips on there are very
apt and useful I&amp;rsquo;ve found it a bit too practical and general. Most chapters
are applicable to any form of meeting (which is good) but I would have loved a
deeper dive into the psychological challenges and things to look out for with
retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>At work we have a group of people which I&rsquo;m part of that work on making sure
we have good frameworks in place for blameless postmortems and organizational
learning as a whole. Part of that is moving past only investigating failure
(via postmortems) and also look into investigating successes (via
retrospectives). So in a similar way to how I&rsquo;ve spent time understanding the
unhelpful concept of human error, I wanted to learn more about the theoretical
concepts of successful retrospectives. Unfortunately this was completely the
wrong book for this. It is a great and very practical read for retrospectives
in the agile sense and how to run successful meetings in general. However I
wasn&rsquo;t looking for that so I constantly kept thinking when we are going to
dive into the meaty, theoretical stuff. This is in no way the authors fault
and I would highly recommend the book as inspiration for improving your
meetings. But for the theoretical underpinnings of retrospectives as an
organizational learning tool I&rsquo;m still on the lookout. Let me know if you have
recommendations :).</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was really looking forward to this book as I&amp;rsquo;ve heard good things about it
and thought it would round up what I already knew about the topic. However
right from the start it felt rather awkward. The author is trying to maintain
an abstract high level view on monitoring and alerting and not go into
specific implementations. This makes for an awkward combination with it being
basically a 101/introductory book on the topic. A lot of the formal
descriptions of monitoring and alerting feel forced and don&amp;rsquo;t hold up in the
abstract very well and are too high level to be practical. He also talks about
operations in an almost romantic hero style way which I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy. In
addition to that the book also includes some final chapters on outage handling
and organizational and cultural setups. The terms human error, root cause
analysis, and &amp;ldquo;5 Whys&amp;rdquo; are thrown around a lot with no acknowledgement of it
being actually harmful to learning according to modern research in the field
of systems safety. Definitely not a book I would recommend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a really great introduction to systems thinking. Meadows does a great
job describing basic system properties, adding examples to illustrate them and
then coming back to them later when describing related properties. A lot of
the described things - especially at the beginning - almost seem like common
sense and suddenly you&amp;rsquo;re neck deep in systems thinking. I especially liked
how she puts systems thinking into relation to being a mindful person. That
it&amp;rsquo;s always a model and not the real world and that we still have to act as
morale humans. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this book Sarah Jeong - a journalist trained as a lawyer at Harvard Law
School - talks about the problem of online harassment. It&amp;rsquo;s another short but
really good one. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a ton about copyright law and the limitations of
current legislation when it comes to online harassment. But also things that
do work and what things could be attempted. It&amp;rsquo;s a very sobering look at the current state of social networks, online harassment and tooling and legislation to help fight it. Definitely worth a read if you spend any time on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m one of those engineers who used to happily claim to not have any frontend
skills and just not be good at design. I came to loathe this thinking over the
years and decided that if I can&amp;rsquo;t do something I want to learn at least the
basics. This is one of the reasons why I read &amp;ldquo;Designing for Performance&amp;rdquo; as
mentioned above. Thankfully I also work with a ton of talented designers and
one of them is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/harllee&#34;&gt;Jessica Harllee&lt;/a&gt;. I talked to her
about suggestions to get started with learning about design. And she said I
should read &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t make me think&amp;rdquo;. And she wasn&amp;rsquo;t wrong. The book is a
wonderful introduction into usability and design. The beauty of it is that
while reading it, all of the things mentioned are total no-brainers. But you
have to remember it while designing things. The other interesting thing for me
was that while all of the examples in the book are web based (with some brief
stints into mobile) I could totally think of CLI apps I&amp;rsquo;ve written in the past
that totally do the wrong thing design-wise. Definitely a recommended read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Men Explain Things to Me</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This collection of essays titled for the aggressive tendency of men to always
have to explain things to women while assuming they have no idea what they are
talking about. The first essay brings this to a point by telling a story of a
party where a man mansplains to the author the book she herself wrote. Without
having actually read it. The book than continues with more essays that talk
about a lot more darker things like discussing domestic violence. The over
arching theme is that the credibility of and respect towards women is
continuously diminished to maintain the status quo and its power imbalance.
Some of the essays towards the end of the book are not easy to read but it&amp;rsquo;s
more than worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another super short read and the de-facto introductory book to
mindfulness meditation. There&amp;rsquo;s not a lot to say here. It&amp;rsquo;s good, give it a
read as it&amp;rsquo;s short enough to not matter if you end up not liking it. I started
meditating regularly after reading it and it has been a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biography of Kate Losse about her time at (early stage) Facebook is in my
mind a must read for any software engineer and especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a man. It
gives an extremely good insight view into what happens when young men are
suddenly in charge of a ton of money. But more importantly it talks very
bluntly about how engineers are treated differently from most other employees
for our supposed gift to turn any idea into gold with code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This short book by Laurie Penny is a very good read about sexism in the age of
social networks and the omnipresent Internet. It does a great job at talking
about how a lot of familiar concepts of &amp;ldquo;offline sexism&amp;rdquo; are reinvented online
and no news to women. It&amp;rsquo;s short and insightful enough to recommend reading it
without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This has been recommended by many people I work with as a wonderful resource
about positive human communication. And as - especially in a growing
engineering org - communication is one of the most important skills to try to
master, I decided to finally read this one. It&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting book with
an approach to communication that is rarely taught especially not to men. It
focuses on a collaborative rather than a competitive style of communication
and the goal to reach agreements over winning arguments. The examples in the
book are often pretty extreme coming from the author&amp;rsquo;s work as a diplomat. And
even though those are great to demonstrate how this way of communicating can
work in the most extreme cases, it also shifts its focus a lot on explicit
diplomatic style discussions. There are more examples that are more directed
towards every day situations and even though the author is very explicit about
this being useful in regular work meetings as well, I had a very hard time
understanding how to practically apply those lessons in a meeting for example.
That being said however it made me think a lot more about the way I
communicate and what I&amp;rsquo;m saying versus what I want to say. I have also applied
that way of communicating successfully at least once since reading the book.
And I look forward to try it out more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

also interviewed for it. &amp;ldquo;You had me at &amp;lsquo;Hellow  World&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; is a collection of
interviews with industry leaders from successful companies about the many
aspects of leadership and mentoring. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty lightweight read and a
great resource to get some insight how successful people talk about those
topics. It does a great job in conveying how important skills outside of
writing code are. And it provides good examples of how to use those for your
advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a very complex relationship with the profession of &amp;ldquo;software
engineering&amp;rdquo; and how it&amp;rsquo;s often defined in a non-inclusive way and as the
profession of the golden children of society. Part of that is that I had
always known a bit about the origins of programming and that a majority of
programmers used to be women. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t know a lot about it which is why I
was excited to read this book. And it was great! The book walks you through
the beginnings before and during WWII and what programming meant back then. It
discusses how the emerging industry in this field changed job prospects and
economic chances for women. But it also discusses how the image of a
programmer changed as more and more men participated. It&amp;rsquo;s full of historical
facts and documents and a more than wonderful read. It sparked a lot of
thoughts for me and changed the way I think about my profession even more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Highly Sensitive Person in Love: Understanding and Managing Relationships When the World Overwhelms You</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really liked the book. It was interesting to read about experiences of other
highly sensitive people and to get a view from a psychologist on it. The book
however has a way too touchy-feely style for me. And especially the final
chapters talking about spirituality were a bit much for me. That being said I
took a couple of things away from reading the book, I was more than once ready
to throw the kindle across the room because my sensitivity got super hijacked
by some things, and I&amp;rsquo;m definitely better informed and at peace with my
sensitivity than I was before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

by some things, and I&rsquo;m definitely better informed and at peace with my

<p>I had no idea about the concept of highly sensitive people until I read <a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4810794" title="Article about Highly Sensitive Person on Huffington Post">this
article</a>. It has a pretty click-baity headline but it really hit home for
me. So I decided to learn more about it and this book was the most prominent
resource to pop up in my search. It&rsquo;s a really good book with a lot of great
psychological insights and explicit case studies. At times the way high
sensitivity was described was a bit too feel-good for my taste. At other times
I would almost throw my kindle across the room as the author managed to really
sneak up on and hijack my sensitivity. The book focuses a lot on what usually
goes wrong during childhood for highly sensitive people and makes it a point
to relive memories and traumas through the lense of high sensitivity. This is
a practice I really enjoyed although it felt a bit much to me at times as I
consider my childhood to have been a happy one. On the other hand I started to
do this practice with every day situations at work to help me understand why I
feel what I feel in different situations. I identify myself as a highly
sensitive person and the book was an extremely good read to
help me understand better what this could mean for me and my days.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about this book ever since it was released and a lot of people I
know speak very highly of it. And they weren&rsquo;t wrong, I basically devoured the
book in a weekend. It&rsquo;s very well written and has a ton of actionable advice
for engineers becoming managers. But I would argue that this description
really limits the value of the book. I have no intention to become a manager
at the moment however the book was really interesting and helpful for me. I
think it&rsquo;s a great read for anyone looking to grow more into a leadership
position.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book sparked my interest while I was looking for improving my daily
routines. I was often just starting the day as it happened often leaving me
feel disorganized, unproductive, and imbalanced. Reading &amp;ldquo;Manage your
Day-to-Day&amp;rdquo; gave me a lot of ideas of what things to try and add to my daily
routine. And also to try and even have a daily routine. Something I picked up
again through this book was journaling and while it has been on and off for
the last couple of months I really enjoy it. The book was not mind blowing for
me but I enjoyed reading it and definitely would recommend it if you are
looking for inspiration for your daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

watching her process and how she knocked out that book. Since then it was on
my list of books to read. Especially since I tend to shy away from frontend
things in my day job and want to get better at not doing that. The book is a
wonderful introduction into web performance especially from a design view. It
gives very solid technical details on a lot of things like browser rendering
and image formats that I only had very superficial knowledge of before. I

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve known about this book for a while now, but up until early 2015 it was
only available in print. And since I don’t really like owning physical books
and read exclusively on my Kindle and iPhone I hadn’t bought it yet. So when I
found out there is a Kindle version now, I immediately bought it. As expected,
the book is really good and gives a good primer on feminism and the historical
context from the author’s perspective. It reads less extreme to me as Greer
which is very much in line with Hooks’ other writing. Definitely highly
recommended for learning more about feminism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Whole Woman</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started reading this book in 2014 and finished it early 2015. I overall
liked it and it was really good in giving me different ways to think about
feminism and how the whole system works together to enable sexism and
exploitation. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good resource to understand better how closely
related feminism and capitalism really are. However it comes with a really
serious trigger warning. Germaine Greer is known to have very
transphobic/cissexist views and this book is no exception. It is restricted to
one chapter but those opinions - which I don&amp;rsquo;t share at all - are definitely
in there. So if this is a trigger for you, it&amp;rsquo;s probably better to skip this
book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating Flow with OmniFocus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This one was kind of a surprise read for me. I’ve written before about how much I have OmniFocus is integrated in my life. And when this book popped up in one of my RSS feeds I decided to give it a read. It’s definitely not a cheap book and I jumped over the first half as it’s basically an introduction into OmniFocus which I already know how to use. The book isn’t a total game changer, but the latter half gives some good food for thought on how to make the most of OmniFocus’ Perspectives and some unusual use cases for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another one I started in 2013 and then dropped for no real reason. I
finished it this year and thoroughly enjoyed it. I knew before I started
reading that I fall on the introvert side of the scale but the book really
helped recognizing some more patterns and making me feel better about it. This
is also the only book I finished as a Kindle audiobook and while I likely
won&amp;rsquo;t do it again, it was an interesting experience. It&amp;rsquo;s a great read and
definitely recommended for anyone who works with other humans in their daily
life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unwiredcouch.com/2014/08/04/human-error-getting-off-the-hook.html&#34; title=&#34;Human Error and Getting Off The Hook on unwiredcouch.com&#34;&gt;human factors and system safety&lt;/a&gt; and
how to apply lessons learned to our field of creating and managing complex
computer systems. So it also shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a surprise that this book really hit
home for me. It&amp;rsquo;s well written and touches on a myriad of different aspects
about how we trade off thoroughness for efficiency and how production pressure
changes our way of making decisions. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty fast read and I really
enjoyed it. It also has a huge references and related literature section
following each chapter which makes it great to start diving deeper into the
topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally started reading it in 2013 when it came out and I enjoyed it back
then. But I somehow still dropped the ball and stopped reading it. I finally
went back and finished it this summer. It&amp;rsquo;s a good and interesting read and
having worked in traditional plant production companies I liked a lot of the
parallels in there. It gets a little weird at the end and the last quarter
feels like the authors really had to wrap up the book. And no matter how you
look at it, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely business romanticism. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind that,
it&amp;rsquo;s definitely entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I added this as a bonus round, because while I definitely read it, I had the
privilege to do so as a reviewer. I’m really happy that Jon asked me to review
his book and while I had done a lot of Chef before, I learned tons about its
internals from this book. If you work with Chef and want to get more out of it
or even just understand some of the internals a little better, definitely read
this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started the year off with finally finishing Germaine Greer&amp;rsquo;s feminist classic
from 1970 about the role of women in modern society. I had known about the book
for a couple of years and after having read “Bell Hooks&amp;rsquo; The Will to Change:
Men, Masculinity, and Love” last year I decided to finally read it. I definitely
enjoyed it. Especially as a man it opens your eyes to a lot of things you never
encounter in your daily life. It&amp;rsquo;s very graphic at times and there are some
long-winded parts in the middle but I would definitely recommend it to anyone
who&amp;rsquo;s interested in feminism. I also started reading her newest book &amp;ldquo;The Whole
Woman&amp;rdquo; this year which is the sequel she never wanted to write. And so far I
like it and it&amp;rsquo;s alarming how few things have changed since &amp;ldquo;The Female Eunuch&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought this book because I wanted to read up more on Feminism, structural
sexism, toxic masculinity, and other related topics. I’ve had many discussions
about these before but never made the time to read actual books about it. I
chose Bell Hooks as the first author to read on the topic as her name came up
in many discussions about the topic. And I chose that book specifically to
learn more about the role of men in all of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>And the book was absolutely great. It does a great job of running through many
areas where sexism and the patriarchy does a lot of harm to men as well. And
it made me think a lot about my upbringing, childhood, and what kind of biases
I carry because of it. But more importantly it made me think about the things
that I value and was at times longing for. E.g. the fact that relationships
between men are often very competitive and don’t provide any space for
emotional depth and vulnerability. Limiting any chance of properly dealing
with emotional situations in that setting.</p>
<p>I can wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone (especially men) interested
in learning more about the topic.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a $3 Kindle purchase before I got on a flight. And with the uptick in
popularity of the Go programming language I thought it would be a good thing
to learn about it. I don’t generally enjoy reading programming books but
rather learn by trying to write some code. But this book did a good job of
guiding me through the language and I felt pretty confident in diving in and
giving it a try. Definitely more than worth the money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t quite sure if I agree with using cucumber for integration testing of
configuration management. And after reading the book I still don’t. It’s hard
to draw the line where you just test the implementation of the config
management framework versus your own business logic. And I think it’s highly
dependent on the level of advanced logic in your config management code.
Although I definitely have seen code that would benefit from some testing like
that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><img src="/images/reading/meyer-riakhandbook-2011-east-river.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Riak handbook is a great overview over one of the most popular and
sophisticated NoSQL databases during the early 2010s. The book guides you
through a number of easy to follow examples to learn all the basic properties
of Riak. It uses JavaScript as an easy accessible language to understand the
examples. It shows that Mathias has done deep research into the database and
has put a lot of effort into creating an accessible resource to learn Riak.</p>
