  <p>I bought this book because I wanted to read up more on Feminism, structural sexism, toxic masculinity, and other related topics. Iâ€™ve had many discussions about these before but never made the time to read actual books about it. I chose Bell Hooks as the first author to read on the topic as her name came up in many discussions about the topic. And I chose that book specifically to learn more about the role of men in all of this.</p>
<p>And the book was absolutely great. It does a great job of running through many areas where sexism and the patriarchy does a lot of harm to men as well. And it made me think a lot about my upbringing, childhood, and what kind of biases I carry because of it. But more importantly it made me think about the things that I value and was at times longing for. E.g. the fact that relationships between men are often very competitive and donâ€™t provide any space for emotional depth and vulnerability. Limiting any chance of properly dealing with emotional situations in that setting.</p>
<p>I can wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone (especially men) interested in learning more about the topic.</p>
