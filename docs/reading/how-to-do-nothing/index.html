  <p>This was one of those books that I started reading with a lot of expectations
that it would be similar to <a href="../digital-minimalism">Digital Minimalism</a>
and tell me a lot of things that I already kinda knew. But I was completely
surprised by it. The book is much more about what to do <em>instead</em> of following
the pull of the attention economy, rather than why it&rsquo;s bad. There is some of
that in there as well of course. However the fascinating part of the book is
much more the fact that it kinda acts like a nice guide about how to re-engage
with your physical surroundings, your city, countryside, and neighborhood. The
real things around you. It took me a while to realize that and read the book
with that in mind. And I definitely struggled early on as there was way more
talk about the dropout communities of the 70s that I really was interested in.
But after finishing the book I definitely have a new-found appreciation of my
neighborhood and the nature around me. It was a very positive read and in the
end not really about &ldquo;doing nothing&rdquo;</p>
