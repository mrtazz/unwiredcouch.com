  <p>This was another book that I didnâ€™t really have any expectations on when I
bought it. And having never really had any philosophy classes in school or
university there was definitely a certain challenge to reading this. Maybe some
of it was also the translation from French but not being used to the way
philosophers talk about topics and structure their sentences it often took me
more than reading a sentence once to understand what was being said. I donâ€™t
think Iâ€™ve really understood what existentialism is after reading the book on a
level where I would be able to argue about it. However there were many
interesting ideas in there about what it means to live in the present and even
such grim topics like the (far) future always presenting death and how to think
about and live with that.</p>
