  <p>It took me a while to get through this book which had less to do with the book itself and more with how I was able to make time to read. So the first couple of chapters were spread out for me over a couple of weeks and thus I had a hard time getting into it. But once I managed to make proper time to read continuously I really enjoyed the flow of the book. It’s much less mathematical than I assumed beforehand. But it’s really well written and does a good job explaining statistical concepts in plain English. And I really appreciated the strong focus on the fact that (good) statistics is more than just applying some formulas but also a hard look at whether the data and the conclusions make sense for the questions that need to be answered.</p>
