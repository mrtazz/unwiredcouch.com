  <p>I really liked the book. It was interesting to read about experiences of other highly sensitive people and to get a view from a psychologist on it. The book however has a way too touchy-feely style for me. And especially the final chapters talking about spirituality were a bit much for me. That being said I took a couple of things away from reading the book, I was more than once ready to throw the kindle across the room because my sensitivity got super hijacked by some things, and I&rsquo;m definitely better informed and at peace with my sensitivity than I was before.</p>
<p>I had no idea about the concept of highly sensitive people until I read <a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4810794" title="Article about Highly Sensitive Person on Huffington Post">this article</a>. It has a pretty click-baity headline but it really hit home for me. So I decided to learn more about it and this book was the most prominent resource to pop up in my search. It&rsquo;s a really good book with a lot of great psychological insights and explicit case studies. At times
the way high sensitivity was described was a bit too feel-good for my taste. At other times I would almost throw my kindle across the room as the author managed to really sneak up on and hijack my sensitivity. The book focuses a lot on what usually goes wrong during childhood for highly sensitive people and makes it a point to relive memories and traumas through the lense of high sensitivity. This is a practice I really enjoyed although it felt a bit much to me at times as I consider my childhood to have been a happy one. On the other hand I started to do this practice with every day situations at work to help me understand why I feel what I feel in different situations. I identify myself as a highly sensitive person and the book was an extremely good read to
help me understand better what this could mean for me and my days.</p>
