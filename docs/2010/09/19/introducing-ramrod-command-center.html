        <h2> <a href=""> Introducing Ramrod Command Center </a></h2>

<p>I have <a href="http://twitter.com/mrtazz/status/24040433982">finally</a> registered my Master’s thesis. This means in 6 month my university life is over and the hard and cruel reality begins. I am writing my thesis at the <a href="http://cone.informatik.uni-freiburg.de">Chair of Computer Networks</a> about localization of nodes without external positioning information. I am going to port the existing algorithms to Unix platforms and create a server environment to be able to use the localization also in networks without direct communication.</p>
<p>The resulting (localization) software has to run on different platforms such as Windows, Unix and the iPhone. This is why I wanted a build system with continuous integration, where the software is built and tested on these platforms. For continuous integration I normally use <a href="http://integrityapp.com">integrity</a> or <a href="http://github.com/defunkt/cijoe">cijoe</a>, which are simple but therefore don’t support notifying builds for several platforms. <a href="http://hudson-ci.org">Hudson</a> has support for agents, but as far as I found out, they have to be hudson agents. For my Master’s project I wanted to be able to use integrity as well as cijoe as agents and have a simple central command instance, which notifies them.</p>
<h3 id="ramrod">Ramrod</h3>
<p>This is why I built <a href="http://github.com/mrtazz/ramrod">ramrod</a>. It is a small sinatra application, which acts as a sort of CI control center. Ramrod can be notified to build a project via simple HTTP POST. All registered agents are then notified subsequently. The agents have to be configured to notify the result back to ramrod, where all the results are then displayed. This can be easily done with cijoe and integrity. Ramrod itself has a simple structure and can be deployed to any ruby hosting platform.</p>
<p>The project is still in a very early stage and there are a lot of things which have to be improved (or even implemented), such as a notification system, authentication and of course a much better design. But I think the initial release v0.1.0 is already quite helpful and usable.</p>
