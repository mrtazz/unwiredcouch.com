        <h2> <a href=""> Setting up workstations with Chef (Newbie Edition) </a></h2>

<p>I have wanted to reinstall and cleanly set up my iMac at home for some time now. And since there was a new release of Mac OS X around the corner, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do so. All my past setups and reinstalls were guided by a useful <a href="https://gist.github.com/513101">gist</a> I forked from <a href="http://kennethreitz.com">Kenneth Reitz</a> some time ago and adopted to my needs. However this time I wanted to do it a bit differently, I wanted to take this as an opportunity to dive into configuration management with <a href="http://opscode.com/chef">Chef</a>. As I prepared my configuration I found a lot of things confusing and not so well documented for a complete newbie. Thus I wanted to share my experience and maybe provide an overview and easier access into the world of Chef. After all once you have your setup it is a pretty nice way to keep your workstations’ configuration in sync and have a documented way how you got there.</p>
<p>The setup I am going to describe is based heavily on Joshua Timberman’s <a href="http://jtimberman.posterous.com/managing-my-workstations-with-chef">post</a> about managing Mac OS X workstations with Chef. If you already know Chef, go read it, it’s great. As all my workstations are running OS X, the steps described are only actually tested on this OS, but should hopefully apply for any other supported OS as well. And of course the setup should be installable to the environment of a normal user (no need to wake up root just because you want to add a plugin to your shell).</p>
<p>However as I am very new to Chef and configuration management, some things may not be described 100% accurately, so read this post with two big hands of salt (or two cups of coffee).</p>
<h3 id="configu-what">Configu-what?</h3>
<p>If you are not familiar with configuration management, you can go read it on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_Management">Wikipedias</a>. But in a nutshell it is the possibility to have an automated build with one build target which is ‘set up the machine production ready’. As in a classical automated software build, the system knows what needs to be done to complete the build target and can track what has already been done. Therefore all steps are idempotent, which means executing a step multiple times always leads to the same result (and no duplicated resources). Therefore it is important that you treat your configuration in the same way you would treat your automated build: There are no steps executed outside the system. If you force yourself to use your configuration management system for every install and configuration you will see how it simplifies your life, at least when you set up a new machine again. Chef is one implementation for such a management system (other popular choices are <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet">Puppet</a> and <a href="http://cfengine.com">cfengine</a>). Chef is (mainly) written in Ruby and supports cookbooks written in Ruby itself or the Chef DSL which we will see in a later example.</p>
<h3 id="to-the-cloud">To the Cloud!!</h3>
<p>Chef comes in two flavours: <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Server">Chef Server</a> and <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo">Chef Solo</a>. The main difference here is that with Chef server everything related to your configuration is managed on a server and machines register on it to get their configuration and then perform all actions locally with <code>chef-client</code>. Chef Solo on the other hand is basically a client run where you have to download your configuration manually beforehand. The downloaded configuration is then used by the executable to set up your machine. So in a Solo run there is no external resource involved, but there are also some features which are only available in the server edition. For managing my own configuration I decided if I am going to learn Chef I might as well do it with the full stack. However setting up Chef server is a real hassle as many different technologies are involved and is not really recommended for someone new to Chef. Fortunately <a href="http://www.opscode.com">Opscode</a> (the company behind Chef) provides a so-called ‘Hosted Chef’ service, which really just means a Chef server in the cloud. And as it is free up until 5 nodes, it is a great way to get started with Chef.</p>
<h3 id="clients-nodes-knife-cookbook-recipe">Clients, nodes, knife, cookbook, recipe?</h3>
<p>The basic terminology can be a bit confusing (especially as half of the search results usually link to gourmet sites). So let’s try to clear some terminology right upfront:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookbooks: Basic Chef configuration/distribution unit</li>
<li>Recipe: Subunit of cookbooks. All basic steps are taken in recipes</li>
<li>Client: A client which connects to the Chef server, level at which certificates are issued</li>
<li>Node: An actual machine which asks the server for its configuration</li>
<li>Roles: Collection of cookbooks which can be assigned to nodes</li>
<li>Knife: Command line client to interact with the Chef server</li>
<li>Data bags: JSON encoded information which doesn’t fit anywhere else to store</li>
</ul>
<p>This might still be a bit confusing, but let’s just start with our configuration to see how these parts all play together. The big benefit of Chef (I’m sure it’s the same with most of the other systems), which is also a point which is often discussed as a weakness, is the fact that everything really is Ruby or json. This means it is source code, which again means we can easily manage it with an SCM (I will use git in the examples, but it really applies to your favourite SCM, too). So let’s start with creating our configuration repository:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>    $ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> chef-repo <span class="kw">;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> chef-repo</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>    $ <span class="fu">git</span> init .</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have our repository set up, we can start to add cookbooks. There are in general two ways to get cookbooks into your repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>create the files and folder yourself</li>
<li>knife (the command line client, remember?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Knife is definitely the better way as you can create cookbook scaffolds, add cookbooks directly from the community site or use one of the great plugins (like pulling cookbooks directly from Github). But to get a better understanding of the cookbook basics, we’ll create everything by hand now.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-cookbook">The first cookbook</h3>
<p>As an example cookbook we’ll want to install <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> with our own custom <code>.zshrc</code>. Although this is probably not such a common install as <code>git</code> for example, it is a reasonably easy one and a good example for how to automate steps which would normally be done manually. The steps we want to automate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>download and install oh-my-zsh</li>
<li>install our custom <code>.zshrc</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So first of all let’s create the basic folder structure:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a>    $ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> -p cookbooks/oh-my-zsh/recipes</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>    $ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> -p cookbooks/oh-my-zsh/templates/default</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>    $ <span class="fu">touch</span> cookbooks/oh-my-zsh/recipes/default.rb</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>    $ <span class="fu">touch</span> cookbooks/oh-my-zsh/templates/default/dot.zshrc.erb</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>    $ <span class="fu">touch</span> cookbooks/oh-my-zsh/README.rdoc</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>    $ <span class="fu">touch</span> cookbooks/oh-my-zsh/metadata.rb</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rough knife equivalent (which creates all the possible folders for the cookbook) would be <code>knife cookbook create oh-my-zsh -o./cookbooks</code>. However in order to get our oh-my-zsh cookbook working, we only need the files and folders shown above. The <code>README.rdoc</code> and <code>metadata.rb</code> files are just for metadata about the cookbook and only the Ruby file is directly parsed by the Chef server for information. But every cookbook should also contain a README which explains its purpose in a spoken language (you create README files for all of your projects, don’t you?).</p>
<p>In order to setup the cookbook, first insert your current <code>.zshrc</code> into <code>oh-my-zsh/templates/default/dot.zshrc.erb</code>. This makes it available to our recipes as a template file. Now we want to configure the actual recipe. Therefore enter the following into <code>oh-my-zsh/recipes/default.rb</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>    script <span class="st">&quot;oh-my-zsh install from github&quot;</span> <span class="kw">do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>      interpreter <span class="st">&quot;bash&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a>      url = https:<span class="ot">//</span>github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a>      code &lt;&lt;-<span class="kw">EOS</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a><span class="ot">        curl -sLf #{</span>url<span class="ot">} -o - | sh</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a><span class="ot">        rm #{</span><span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;HOME&#39;</span>]<span class="ot">}/.zshrc</span></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span class="ot">      </span><span class="kw">EOS</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a>      not_if { <span class="dt">File</span>.directory? <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span><span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;HOME&#39;</span>]<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/.oh-my-zsh&quot;</span> }</span>
<span id="cb3-9"><a href="#cb3-9"></a>    <span class="kw">end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This just executes the shell script passed to the <code>code</code> directive. The used interpreter is <code>bash</code> and the <code>not_if</code> directive secures the idempotency of this step. The script is only executed if the directory <code>~/.oh-my-zsh</code> does not exist. The shell script just contains the usual oh-my-zsh installer and removes the generic <code>.zshrc</code> which is important for the next step. As we want to install our own config file but don’t want to do it everytime, we use the following Chef block (written to <code>oh-my-zsh/recipes/default.rb</code> directly after the install script):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a>    template <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span><span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;HOME&#39;</span>]<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/.zshrc&quot;</span> <span class="kw">do</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>      mode   <span class="bn">0700</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>      owner  <span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;USER&#39;</span>]</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>      group  <span class="dt">Etc</span>.getgrgid(<span class="dt">Process</span>.gid).name</span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a>      source <span class="st">&quot;dot.zshrc.erb&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a>      variables({ <span class="st">:home</span> =&gt; <span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;HOME&#39;</span>] })</span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a>      not_if { <span class="dt">File</span>.exist? <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span><span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;HOME&#39;</span>]<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/.zshrc&quot;</span> }</span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a>    <span class="kw">end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This creates the file given as the template parameter (our zsh config file) with the given properties. It makes sure the file is owned and only readable by us, takes the content from the <code>dot.zshrc.erb</code> template and passes <code>variables</code> to the renderer. As you might have already seen, templates are just <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html">ERB</a>. This means we can use the ERB syntax (<code>&lt;%= var %&gt;</code>) within a template to insert dynamic content passed from the recipe.</p>
<p>One additional step, we might want to take, is source <code>.profile</code> in our config file. This is especially useful if you use environment management like <a href="http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/">rvm</a>, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spawngrid/kerl">kerl</a>. These usually need to be activated in the shell config. In order to make sure that they are present in every shell the activation step is written into <code>.profile</code>. Therefore we also want to source it in our zsh config. The <code>not_if</code> method here also conserves the idempotency of the step.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a>    script <span class="st">&quot;source .profile in .zshrc&quot;</span> <span class="kw">do</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>      interpreter <span class="st">&quot;bash&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a>      code &lt;&lt;-<span class="kw">EOS</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span class="ot">      echo &quot;source #{</span><span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;HOME&#39;</span>]<span class="ot">}/.profile&quot; &gt;&gt; #{</span><span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;HOME&#39;</span>]<span class="ot">}/.zshrc</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a><span class="ot">      </span><span class="kw">EOS</span></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6"></a>      not_if <span class="st">&quot;grep \&quot;source </span><span class="ot">#{</span><span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;HOME&#39;</span>]<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/.profile\&quot; </span><span class="ot">#{</span><span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;HOME&#39;</span>]<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/.zshrc&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7"></a>    <span class="kw">end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="the-server-comes-into-play">The server comes into play</h3>
<p>After finishing these steps, we can upload the cookbook to our server. In order to be able to do this, the server needs to be set up, so if you haven’t already <a href="http://www.opscode.com/hosted-chef/">sign up</a> for a free hosted chef. After creating your organization, put your client and validation certificates in <code>~/.chef</code>. I find this to be a convenient place for all your Chef related configuration, but you can of course choose another directory (just make sure that you also adapt subsequent steps in this post accordingly). Now we can upload our cookbook with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a>    <span class="ex">knife</span> cookbook upload oh-my-zsh</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have a cookbook on the server now, but no node uses it, yet (we also don’t have nodes set up at the moment but bear with me here). In order to match nodes to cookbooks Chef employs the concept of ‘run lists’. These are basically lists of recipes which can be added to a node so that it knows what to install. As run lists are mostly very similar between nodes of the same category, we can set up a role for it in Chef. A role is just a specific set of attributes and a run list which is mapped to a name. As there may be multiple machines we use as workstations we create a role ‘workstation’ in the roles directory of our Chef repository:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a>    $ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> -p roles</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>    $ <span class="fu">touch</span> roles/workstation.rb</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again this is just Ruby so we add the following information to <code>workstation.rb</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a>    name <span class="st">&quot;workstation&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>    description <span class="st">&quot;development workstations&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a>    run_list(</span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4"></a>      <span class="st">&quot;recipe[oh-my-zsh]&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5"></a>    )</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now every node which is assigned the ‘workstation’ role will know that it has to install chef <code>oh-my-zsh</code> recipe. Let’s upload the role to our server:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a>    $ <span class="ex">knife</span> upload role from file workstation.rb</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the management web interface (or via <code>knife</code>) we can now assign the role ‘workstation’ to specific nodes. However we first need a client which is allowed to connect to the server API. Clients and nodes are somewhat the same in Chef. Theoretically it is possible that a client manages a number of nodes, but normally every node corresponds to one client. Therefore we create a new client for our workstation. You can also run <code>chef-client</code> on your node and provide the validator certificate for your organization. If the node does not yet exist on the server it is created. However this means that you have to have the validator certificate (which is the ultimate key to your server) on the node. This might not be a problem for setting up your development machine, but is bad security in general. So the better way is to create the client and node on the server and provide the correct credentials (at least read and update) for the client on the node. One more advantage is that we can now already assign roles to our nodes (via the ‘Roles’ menu) and add the ‘workstation’ role to the newly created node. All these steps can of course also be accomplished with <code>knife</code>, but I find the web management console easier to start with. When all this is done, download the client’s certificate and also put it in <code>~/.chef</code>. Theoretically your node is correctly set up already. However Chef makes the assumption that it is run with privileges. Therefore the default data directory is in <code>/etc/chef</code>. As we want to setup our development machine and not a server, it makes sense to run <code>chef-client</code> as your normal user. In order to do this, you would now have to make the default directories accessible for your user. But we can also override the paths used in the client config. I also keep my paths in <code>~/.chef</code> (everything in one place, remember?) so a good adaption of your <code>client.rb</code> might be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a>    base_dir = <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span><span class="dt">ENV</span>[<span class="st">&#39;HOME&#39;</span>]<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/.chef&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>    run_path <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span>base_dir<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/run&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3"></a>    checksum_path <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span>base_dir<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/checksum&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4"><a href="#cb10-4"></a>    file_cache_path <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span>base_dir<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/cache&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5"><a href="#cb10-5"></a>    file_backup_path <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span>base_dir<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/backup&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-6"><a href="#cb10-6"></a>    cache_options({<span class="st">:path</span> =&gt; <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ot">#{</span>base_dir<span class="ot">}</span><span class="st">/cache/checksums&quot;</span>, <span class="st">:skip_expires</span> =&gt; <span class="dv">true</span>})</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will make sure only subdirectories of <code>~/.chef</code> will be used for caching, checksums, etc. After these steps there is only one thing to do.</p>
<h3 id="sit-back-and-watch">Sit back and watch</h3>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a>    $ <span class="ex">chef-client</span> -c ~/.chef/client.rb -k ~/.chef/client.pem</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above command will run the Chef client with the specified config and client certificate. It will then fetch the cookbooks from the server, determine which to execute via the nodes run list and run them. If everything went well you now have oh-my-zsh installed and can go on and add additional cookbooks to your repository.</p>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3>
<p>You should now be equipped with a basic working setup to create your configuration with Chef. Play around with new cookbooks and try to force yourself to do everything system configuration related in terms of cookbooks and data bags. You’ll only learn it by doing it. If you feel comfortable enough with this basic setup, see the following links for some more sophisticated possibilities.</p>
