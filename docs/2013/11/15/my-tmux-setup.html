      <div class="post">
        <h1 class="posttitle"> <a href=""> My Tmux Setup </a></h1>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net">tmux</a> as my main terminal multiplexer for about 3 years
now and have refined my configuration over time to fit my daily workflow.
Which is usually a mix of writing code, chef recipes, remote login into
different servers and various shell tasks. This is a flexible setup that
doesn&rsquo;t concentrate too much on doing a specific thing or replacing an IDE
inside of tmux. The <a href="https://github.com/mrtazz/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux.conf">configuration</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mrtazz/zshfiles/blob/master/zshrc">shell aliases</a> are
up on GitHub if you want to check them out.</p>
<h3 id="the-basics">The Basics</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the basics. By default tmux uses <code>ctrl-b</code> as its prefix key
for commands and escaping. But the years of using screen have ingrained in my
muscle memory to use <code>ctrl-a</code>, so I switched with this simple setting:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>unbind C-b
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>set -g prefix C-a
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I also added a couple of important baseline settings to make tmux in general
look nice in colored terminals and work with unicode in the display window as
well as in the status bar. I also wanted to have the window numbering start at
1, since it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me for accessing succesive windows to start
on the right side of the keyboard and then continue on the left side. And I
also wanted to have a simple shortcut (<code>ctrl-a r</code>) to reload configuration in
a live tmux session whenever I change something.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># force a reload of the config file
unbind r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

# start window numbering at 1 for easier switching
set -g base-index 1

# colors
set -g default-terminal &#34;screen-256color&#34;

# unicode
setw -g utf8 on
set -g status-utf8 on
</code></pre><p>The next important change was modifying the status bar. There are a lot of
crazy things you can do and overload your tmux status bar with more
information than you could ever need. I try to balance the contents of my
status bar to only have information in there I actually care about. This means
I have the local hostname and the name of the current session on the left side
and then all the windows. The right side contains the current battery status
(when I&rsquo;m on a laptop), the status of my mail (inbox, to read, to answer) and
the time and date. Although I see less and less benefit of having the mail
check in there and will probably remove it soon (currently it&rsquo;s only showing
the inbox mail count). I also have the status bar configured to show terminal
bells in red so I always know when there is something that needs attention in
a window (I have weechat and mutt set to alert via terminal bells). For the
colorscheme I use a <a href="https://github.com/seebi/tmux-colors-solarized">solarized light</a> theme as you can see in
the screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/tmux-status.png" alt="tmux status bar"></p>
<p>And the configuration for my status bar looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># status bar config
set -g status-left &#34;#h:[#S]&#34;
set -g status-left-length 50
set -g status-right-length 50
set -g status-right &#34;⚡ #(~/bin/tmux-battery) [✉#(~/bin/imap_check.py)] %H:%M %d-%h-%Y&#34;
setw -g window-status-current-format &#34;|#I:#W|&#34;
set-window-option -g automatic-rename off

# listen to alerts from all windows
set -g bell-action any
</code></pre><p>This is the base configuration I use for basic project sessions with tmux. I
have two simple shell aliases to make it easier to re-attach to a session and
create new ones based on the current directory I&rsquo;m in:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>alias tma<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;tmux attach -d -t&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>alias git-tmux<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;tmux new -s $(basename $(pwd))&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With those I can ran <code>tma &lt;tab&gt;</code> in any shell and get a tab completion list
for all the current sessions running. Which is handy when logging into a
machine or generally working in a new shell. The second one I usually use when
I checked something in a local project (which are usually in git hence the
name of the alias) and then decided that I want a proper workspace but don&rsquo;t
have an existing session already. The alias will just create a new session on
the spot and name it after the current directory name. This also has the big
advantage that all new shells spawned inside of tmux (e.g. opening a new
window with <code>ctrl-a c</code>) will be started in that directory. Within those open
sessions I have some more important shortcuts I use often. They allow me to
cycle through panes (vertical or horizontal splits in a window created with
<code>ctrl-a V</code> and <code>ctrl-a H</code>) with <code>ctrl-a a</code> and to switch between windows with
<code>ctrl-a &lt;tab&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># rebind pane tiling
bind V split-window -h
bind H split-window

# quick pane cycling
unbind ^A
bind ^A select-pane -t :.+

# screen like window toggling
bind Tab last-window
bind Escape copy-mode
</code></pre><p>And last but not least in every basic setup - as an avid vim user - movement
commands live on the home row of course. And different panes can be selected
with <code>ctrl-a</code> and the corresponding movement command.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># vim movement bindings
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R
</code></pre><h3 id="next-level">Next Level</h3>
<p>I used to use tmux sessions in multiple tabs in iTerm for a long time.
However these sessions became very long living and whenever I needed to update
iTerm (which wasn&rsquo;t that often to be honest) I had to recreate the tabs again
as I wanted. Additionally I felt it was unnecessary to have multiple ways of
doing basically the same thing (iTerm tabs and tmux windows/sessions) when I
can just decide to use one. So I decided to switch to tmux as the main working
environment on the laptop for everything. This means I have a tmux session on
my laptop dedicated to communication which has a window that runs mosh with an
attached tmux session from the server where I run weechat. And another window
that does the same to my work VM which runs my work IRC client. And another
window that just runs mutt for email reading. This means at any given time I
have two nested tmux sessions as you can see in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/nested-tmux.png" alt="nested tmux"></p>
<p>This lets me reattach the communications session even when I accidentally
close my terminal and have it be exactly how I left it off. Even when I don&rsquo;t
connect to a remote host, I often have nested tmux sessions locally since I
use it basically like terminal tabs. This is very useful but needs one more
setting in the configuration to work. Since both nested tmux sessions expect
the same meta command, I have this stanza in my configuration:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>bind-key a  send-prefix
</code></pre><p>This sends the command prefix to the inner tmux session when I hit <code>ctrl-a a</code> thus enabling me to execute commands in nested tmux sessions.</p>
<p>In order to easily switch between sessions I mainly use to important
commands. The first one is the tmux built-in <code>ctrl-a s</code> which gives me a
list of all current sessions on the system (the same list the <code>tma</code> tab
completion gives me) and I can easily switch sessions from within a tmux
session. However this means finding the session I want in a list that might
contain 20 or more sessions. And all I really want is to switch to the
session named &ldquo;chef&rdquo;. This is why I added another extremely useful shortcut:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># bind fast session switching
unbind S
bind S command-prompt &#34;switch -t %1&#34;
</code></pre><p>Now when I hit <code>ctrl-a S</code> I get a <code>(switch)</code> prompt where I can enter the name
of the session I want (or just the prefix as long as it is unique) and switch
to that session when hitting <code>Return</code>. This is super helpful since I have most
of my sessions named after the directory/project name anyways. So I usually
know which session to switch to.</p>
<h3 id="we-have-to-go-deeper">We have to go deeper</h3>
<p>But this is not the end yet. I have one more very useful bit of configuration
I use everyday which is related to how I remote login into servers. For this
purpose I have a tmux session on a server called &ldquo;jumpsessions&rdquo; in which I
open a new tmux window whenever I ssh into a server. However this got very
confusing after a while and I had no idea what all those windows were. So I
added this little bit into my <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Host *
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>PermitLocalCommand yes
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>LocalCommand <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#f92672">[[</span> $TERM <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> screen* <span style="color:#f92672">]]</span>; <span style="color:#66d9ef">then</span> printf <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;\033k%h\033\\&#34;</span>; <span style="color:#66d9ef">fi</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This runs a local command on each ssh login on the server I login in. With the
effect that it prints the local hostname with an escape sequence that triggers
tmux to set the window title to that hostname. This means if I now open the
list of windows (<code>ctrl-a w</code>) I can see to which server each window is
connected. And this is also the reason why I have automatic window renaming
turned off.</p>
<p>But of course I don&rsquo;t want to browse through all of those windows
to get to a server, so I just use the &ldquo;find-window&rdquo; command in tmux (<code>ctrl-a f</code>) and enter the server name (which is also the window name) and will
automatically switch to the correct session on hitting enter.</p>
<p>And as the final stage of inception, I often run a screen session on those
servers to execute long running commands. Which means I&rsquo;m now three levels
deep into terminal multiplexers and it still works like a charm.</p>
